Reddit,"Can someone explain this to me? I don't get the argument of ""its a PvE game, the devs shouldn't need to balance It or release patch notes""  I've seen this alot of times on various PvE subreddits. When something that was very good in that game gets nerfed, people usually say something like ""why are the devs so focused on nerfing things in a PvE game?"" Or ""who complained about this being OP, the NPCS?"" 

I don't get this viewpoint. If the devs designed a PvE games items, guns, cars tools, etc. to be balanced alongside each other, and make each have their own advantages and drawbacks, then they have every right to correct a mistake, like say an OP M4 that one shots all NPC enemies across all ranges, compared to the other assault rifles that have 3-4 shots to kill (extreme example, but you get what I mean). 

Some people argue that if you don't want the game to be a cakewalk, don't use the OP thing. But then it's basically just nerfing yourself in a video game to keep the balance that the devs themselves should've kept. ",-0.6993

Reddit,"Actual statistics and facts of League of Legends F2P and Paid nerfs I saw [post like this](https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1i0l01k/league_of_legends_players_estimates_that_it_takes/) and thought to myself to paint the entire picture of what is happening.  
  
&nbsp;

A few things to note:  
-**Q**: Why here? and not r/LeagueofLegends?  
**A**: That sub has been in permanent e-sports mode for years, most criticism of the game is instantly removed. You aren't even allowed to post bugs, Account or Riot support issues, technical or product issues, or anything that isn't esport/praising the game or Riot could be removed or locked for the most insane reasons ever. The sub has been in PR mode for years now.  
  
-The player reward nerfs have been an on-going thing since mid to late 2018 where every free, paid, and whale option has been getting worse and worse over time while prices of Riot points (LoL's in-game currency) has nearly DOUBLED!!   
This completely fucks over peoples ability to play the game, try out new characters, and breaks the reason for some of the core account features existence.
Something on a much smaller scale has [happened before](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7budg2/the_math_behind_the_new_blue_essence_changes_and/).  
  
-**Q**: Isn't this a bug lmao?  
**A: NO IT IS [NOT A BUG](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1hy3ohj/it_seems_that_after_this_patch_it_will_take_882/)**.  
  
&nbsp;

**Part1 : Blue essence**  
  
The cost of all the champions in the game with Mel (from arcane) would be exactly **531,985BE**.  
The only non-paid source of BE is the ""new and improved battle pass"" that gives **4750BE + 4 champion capsules which on average gives you 500ish BE**.  
There are 6 battle passes per YEAR.   
That means you get roughly 40,500BE annually...that's over **13 years of playing the game to own the CURRENT roster**.  
Most people aren't no-life andies that grind 20 games per day to even get to the repeatable part of the BP which is beyond useless since it has a HARD CAP ON IT.  
Yes you read it right, you cannot infinitely grind the ""infinitely repeatable"" part of the BP due to BP EXP being a limited resource.   
  
Either play 13 years, buy an account with all champs, buy that XboxGamePass, or fork over 115,400RP which is about 740£ (900$).  
  
It cannot get worse right?  
  
&nbsp;

**Part 1.1: New accounts ranked eligibility**    
    
To be able to play ranked in LoL you need your account to be level30, have played 10 normal games on Summoners rift, **AND OWN 20 CHAMPS**.  
How would new accounts/players ever become eligible for ranked if it takes an average Joe a couple of years to get 20 champs?  
  
**Part 1.2: Clash Tickets**   
   
Once every now and again, there are Clash events in league of legends. These are basically you and your friends vs other people in a tournament style ladder.  
The tickets for them come in 2 variety: basic and premium, only the basic version can be bought with BE and the rewards for it are abysmal at best.  
With the new system the amount of BE you make isn't enough to sustain the amount these tickets need.  
Meaning if you want to play with your friends sooner or later you need to open the wallet.  
  
**Part 1.3: New account missions**  
  
With the new update they have removed new account missions that gave a substantial amount of BE and account XP. Making the grind even worse.

&nbsp;

**Part 2: Honour and Skill**  
  
Before if you performed well enough , you would get rewarded with a Hextech chest.  
The idea was to encourage players to player better.  
   
To open the chests you need keys that you get from being positive or just not an asshole.  
The idea was to encourage player to be less toxic.   
   
Both of these together helped encourage players to play better and be less toxic, wasn't nearly enough since rewards weren't the root cause and the absolute lack of any real punishment was and still is.  
With 1 update they removed chests for playing well.  
In other words it doesn't even matter to not be an asshole any more, since both of you get 0 rewards thanks to chests now being behind a paywall.  
  
If anything being positive is worse, since now you get a bunch of keys in your inventory that you can't use unless you open your wallet.
**This is a dark pattern 100% and Intentional.**  
  
&nbsp;

**Part 3: Mastery and time sink**  
  
Before this incredible update, levelling up your account meant something. Now it means nothing and it represents nothing either.  
It's just an arbitrary number that goes up.  
Similar to another system called mastery, which was also worthless since there wasn't any real achievements or anything really tied to them and just another arbitrary number that went up forever.  
  
&nbsp;

**Part 4: They are still selling the useless stuff btw**  
  
Now with account level being worthless, Level boosts are useless too.  
Since it was intentional to remove them and no trillion dollar company randomly removes multiple core reward mechanics out of nowhere without subbing something in, you'd think they'd remove the level boosts since they do literally nothing any more right?  
Nah keep'em in, who cares if people get scammed.  
  
&nbsp;

**Part 5: New ""upto"" 250$ gacha skin**  
  
As it is common with en-shitification of products and services, they come up utter trash, overpriced products and make sure they use dark patterns do maximize sales.  
When you go to check your loot, you see the skin.  
In game the statue to the old 500$ skin is still there after months, that skin is unobtainable btw.  
Gacha, FoMo and Constant face shove tactics.  
  
&nbsp;

**Part 6: Abandoning previous systems**  
   
In recent years they finally added an achievement/tacking system (yes the 5th tracking system in the game as if they didn't have enough).  
""We will keep the system updated with new achievement and trackers each season""  
It hasn't seen a single update for over 2 years...  
With the new season they added a bunch of new stuff and could you imagine that none of them got their achievement or even count towards the old ones?  
  
  
&nbsp;

The situation has been getting worse over years but this update was just disgusting.  
There is no way they remove every possible way the players can earn ANYTHING at the same time and not fix or address it in hours.  
This is riot games, they have done 1 hour after update hotfixes before and they've alrady passed a balance hotfix. It is NOT A BUG, fully intentional.  
Do not recommend anyone to play this game under any circumstance.  
Utter shameful.  

&nbsp;

  
**Edit**:  
  
**Part 7: Small stuff**  
  
-They changed summoner to some of the most [ugly designs](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1hhhh79/the_icons_of_the_summoner_spells_will_be_updated/) known to man kind.  
Not only are they ugly but their design doesn't fit the current item/chaampion/ui designs that they sit next to.  
  
-Ranked victorious skins went from being a proof of skill back in early seasons to... a participation trophy...just play 15 games now. No more get to gold rank.  
  
&nbsp;

**Part 8: Sneaky and Disingenuous**  
  
Riot did not mention ANY OF THESE IN PATCH NOTES. AT ALL!!  
Just sneak change every thing.  
They even changed their FAQ page as the patch went out. [Old](http://web.archive.org/web/20240223172544/https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036422453-Hextech-Crafting-FAQ) [New](https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036422453-Hextech-Crafting-FAQ)

Reddit,"Company of Heroes 3 is pretty amazing now! After the terrible release of the unfinished game last year that left most players very disappointed, I’ve also walked away from the game to wait and see if things get better. 

Since there have been quite a few updates and patches in the past year and as things are getting stable now, I got back into the game a weeks ago to gave it another try, and I wanna say the game is pretty amazing now! Almost all problems we saw from the early release were fixed and now we have a well polished well balanced WWII competitive RTS game as it is suppose to be, with a very interesting single player campaign. 

It is nice to see the player count improving but it is definitely far from justifying the game quality at the moment, thus I think some advocates for the game is nice. If you are waiting to get back to it or is looking for a tactical RTS game to play, I would certainly recommend give it a try now! ",0.9841

Reddit,"Gamers need to unite- PLEASE READ- (Microtransactions) CLICK HERE FOR PETITION https://goo.gl/n2tMb6 
""Adapt gambling laws to include gambling in video games, which target children.""

  

Ladies, and gentlemen of the gaming world. I have followed this subreddit for a year or two now but I have never posted but I see now is the right time. 

Look around us, We all know it, Microtransactions , Loot boxes and ""pay to win"",  whatever they try and call it. The inclusion of these practices in our games have effectively ruined them. Im 19 years old, like many of you I am old enough to remember the time where there weren't as many of these blatant cash grabs happening, if any.

Think about it for a minute, 
Battlefront 2,
Shadow of war,
Blizzard/ Overwatch(although not as bad since its merely cosmetic),
Forza 7, and more. 

Even with games that have strictly cosmetic boxes(voice lines and stickers and skins). While some may deem this more acceptable it is still a slot machine like system as there is an element of loss that can occur, if you get a duplicate item or a poor rated item.It can be addicting. Especially when there is anything that adds content, Abilities, and otherwise content that is either not available for other players or requires hours of purposely implemented grinding in a FPS is unacceptable.This will lead to more shots of 2.99 loot boxes in the hopes that this will give you the item you desire. 


They are ruining the even and level playing fields of multiplayer games, and even intruding in single player game play now. There are studies done to show that micro transactions have led to gambling later in life. Once again,loot Boxes are very similar to slot machines. Sometimes you win (good item) sometimes you lose (duplicate or bad item). It is a legal form of gambling and should be regulated as such. I pay 60 dollars of a game, I don't want to have to be forced to pay more because games are purposely designed to either have hours of grinding. Its unfair especially for people who are less fortunate; as well as children and adults alike who are susceptible to behavior like this, especially when it is encouraged by publishers. While I personally do not mind paying for DLC/expansions that add lot's of content like Dragonborn or Dawnguard for skyrim just to give an example. But Cash grabs and so called loot boxes like the ones in BF2 need to go.

While on the subject I feel like it’s necessary to give credit where credit is due to keep this fair. I feel personally that the one of the only few games that does achieve a balance, that is not built to drag people, does not force me or make me feel like I need to buy a lootbox is Overwatch. You earn them constantly, its only cosmetic, and they are not in your face about it, and the game is hugely enjoyable.

Arguably Skyrim SE, and Fallout 4's Creation Club has struck attention from the community, however this is a whole other issue which I will not be discussing, since there is not a lot the community can actively do to resolve it, as it is NOT considered gambling.Going back a little more, to GTA 5, a game that i still do love and play on occasion. The online was plagued by micro transactions, and people bought them because missions were purposely made to payout low and make buying with real money more viable.. Its so disappointing that we as a gaming community have let the greed of gaming companies like Rockstar North come this far without acting on it. And i am not a cynic either, I genuinely love most games,My favorite game of all time is The Elder Scrolls Skyrim, but shenanigans like this NEED to come to an end. Again, these are whole other issues which I wont be discussing here since there is not a lot the community can actively do to resolve it. 


In conclusion, I don't know about any of you, but its been a while since i have really jumped on a new game. What I am asking is, Share this message, write poor reviews, don't buy into the micro transactions, even dont buy the games if you can help it. Until such practices are less or totally gone. We did it for For Honor, And we did it for ESO, We even did it for the first round of paid mods on Steam. We can do it for this gamers!! Stop unfair game inclusions of pay to win material! Stop the paywalls!!

Edit: I have revised my post by adjusting to the overall stance that the community has, and to be more specific and detailed as well as to try and be more inclusive and fair. Thank you for all the comments and constructive criticism. Keep it coming!!!",0.9978
Reddit,"Star Wars Battlefront patch adds new maps, somewhat balances A-Wing ",-0.7003
Reddit,"How do you feel about any PvE games getting balance patches? When I say balance patches, it's what you expect: Buffs and nerfs to aspects of the game to make it more enjoyable. PvP balance is to make sure everyone is on a level playing field and that nothing is too broken or too weak. But how does this apply to PvE? It's only players going against bots so why does it matter if players are overpowered? It's the most common argument against PvE getting any kind of balance patches and I feel like this falls flat hard for multiple reasons.  


The point of balance patches is to, like stated earlier, change parts of the game to make sure nothing is too weak or too OP. So what happens if there's a consistent OP strategy that everyone can easily do? People abuse that strategy for easy wins, this gets even worse in Co-op games as now you will always see people running the same strategy. Let's take Payday 2 as an example, they have a history of reworking and changing skills so they can become not only viable and fun but also not broken. Silencer skills are too powerful and common? Remove the important one that buffs damage and compensate by buffing every gun's damage. Now how about the Binding of Isaac? Let's buff underused characters and items to make them more fun to play with.  


Balancing PvE games is just as important as PvP games, but for different reasons. PvP balances are to make sure everyone's on a leveled playing field while PvE balances are focused on making gameplay diverse and challenging. I might be the only person that thinks this, but I want to know how you feel about it.",0.9843

Reddit,"Choices matter hell... I have a very big issue with this type of games.

It's not a rule, but more often than not it completely breaks the game for me.

My problem with those games, is that in most cases you get locked out of part of the content, based on the decisions you made.

In my opinion this is a very poor game design, artificially forcing you to do multiple playthroughs, if you want to see complete content.

As I never do more than one playthrough of any single player game, I feel somewhat robbed of a full experience.

Another complaint that I could log, is that at their launch many of these games are not balanced well enough, meaning if you pick a ""wrong"" side, you might be underpowered, compared to others.

This inherently leads me to not playing them until at least one or two major patches land, or I might skip them completely, if they fall off my radar.

If I am being completely honest, I would also have to blame my OCD, for wanting to see, and do, everything there is in every game I play, and wanting to min-max my character(s) each time.

Anyone else out there, with similar issues?   

Edit: based on early comments, I want to elaborate.  
For me it would be a much better game design if your choices dictate on which side of the situation/discussion, your character ends up, not completely lock you out of certain content.",-0.1801

Reddit,"""Black Myth: Wukong"" Review. It's alright! tl;dr: Bad level design, shaky stability, great gameplay and good bosses over a surprisingly long but well-paced period. The story is very hard to track if you're not familiar with JttW. I'd still recommend on just the merits of the gameplay and bosses, and it'll be an excellent game to get on sale.  
  
Every now and again there's a game that comes out that has so many conflicting opinions that you just have to play it for yourself to establish your own feelings about it. Wukong is absolutely one of those games. I've not seen the same opinion about it from anybody, and so I'm throwing in yet another perspective into the ring. This is going to be a spoiler free review.

My perspective: I'm an English-speaking American Buddhist, with no familiarity with Journey to the West and very, very little familiarity with Chinese Buddhism. I generally like single-player games, souls games, and well-balanced challenges with a strong feeling of progression. 

Performance/Fidelity: Eh  
On PC, I found the game to be decent. The lighting was awkward without ray tracing, there were regular random crashes (that are getting patched), and there was odd pixelation on certain assets. The art direction is fantastic, and this game does have an excellent balance of visual fidelity to style, but I kind of wish they leaned more style over raw density. All said, I did enjoy looking at and listening to the game at pretty much all times. 

Story: ???  
It is really hard to rate the story, as not only am I not familiar with the source material, much of what's said contradicts my other understandings. The story is also portrayed in a very all-over-the-place way, that I wasn't ready for. This isn't an ""empty"" story, like you'd expect from a souls game or a quiet metroidvania. This is a very detailed story that I'm completely unprepared to understand. 

This is distinctly my fault. I went in expecting a game-depiction of Journey to the West. That's not what this is. As far as I can tell, this is a progression from JttW, and treats that work as well-known to the player. 

And that's okay! From what I've heard, people into JttW adore the story and depictions, and the (Chinese, I haven't heard the English) voice acting is solid. There's a lot of character variety, I enjoyed every NPC to some extent, and the general story pacing is very solid. Even with what little I could grasp, I found hunting the secret paths and finishing the story very satisfying. 

Level Design: Bad.  
By far the worst part of the game is the level design. This game is almost exclusively boss fights, with very few non-boss fight encounters even being memorable. The only times I remember caring about a fight that wasn't a boss fight was two particular segments where I kept falling to my death along an annoyingly-placed set of enemies over a bottomless pit, and one particular boulder dodging incident. There's a spell that makes most of these segments irrelevant. Most enemies fall over to your light attack combo or to a fully charged heavy anyway. I remember far more times where the game threw two to three bosses at me in a row in the same hallway, or in the same room at separated intervals.   
  
The levels are designed as narrow corridors with slight branches. This is a fine design, except that they rarely visually match this depiction. There are invisible walls everywhere, often at times you wouldn't expect them, and they're missing in unexpected times that you have to trial and error to find. It's not elegant. 

Places look great, and there's fun moments of branching and interweaving on occasion, but it's not unfair to treat most levels as just straight roads from boss fight to boss fight. There was one particular moment where I thought the game was opening up, only to just be to handle multiple boss fights. 

Gameplay and Progression: Great  
This is by far my favorite part of the game. The game almost immediately gets you hooked on the idea that doing side branches and looking around for stuff will get you neat upgrades and new tools, and never really lets up on that. As much as the game is mostly boss fights, I almost always felt proportionately rewarded with how difficult the boss fight was, which is an unexpected feeling after playing so many games with bosses as intrinsic motivation. There's a flood of progression-related resources you get early which can be overwhelming, but as you start spending them they all start to make intuitive sense. 

Armor and weapons (always the same moveset) are designed to support various styles, and use the classic ""Common Rare Epic Legendary Mythic"" coloring style, despite being concrete unlockables with no random dropped gear in the game. This feels odd, but the practical result is that you'll have a variety of different tools to use and a lot of freedom to switch between them.

The skill tree is massive, but playing will get you pretty quickly familiar with what tools you want. It gets pretty obvious pretty quickly how you're going to want to spend your points, and you can freely move them around. The ability to freely respec to upgrade new spells and make the most of new gear is fantastic. 

There's a few types of spells that I won't spoil, but I enjoyed finding and using them a lot. There's a lot of sub-benefits to many skills, giving you surprise interrupts or protects, that are great to keep in mind when shaking up your skillset.

Bosses: Pretty Good  
The gameplay for most bosses is solid, but not excellent. Bosses have inconsistent hitboxes, there's some odd snappiness to the animations, and genuinely if they removed every grab attack without replacement, the game would be better.   
  
That said, their difficulty feels very solidly toned, leaning on the easier side, and most bosses react extremely well to you changing up your strategy. There were a good few fights where I tried about 5 times, felt I was lacking, changed up my gear and tree to try something I'd never used, and crushed on the next attempt. That feeling of the game responding to changes in strategy is one of its strongest, and reminds me a lot of Thymesia (a game I love). There's definitely a few difficult bosses, and I appreciated how the game's spectacle ramped up as it went. 

Overall: It's alright! It's leaning a lot on the player-side gameplay for me. I don't think the actual bosses hold up that well, and the story and level design definitely won't be why I come back, but as the game took me 60 hours I don't think I'll need to return. It's satisfying, and I can recommend it if anything above seemed appealing, or you're even slightly more familiar with Journey to the West than I am. For devs as inexperienced as these, for what they made, it's impressive. But, if you're someone who's looking at this as just a product, I think it's only worth it if you're deeply curious about the game, are extremely familiar with Sun Wukong's story, or if it's on sale.

Heroes of the Storm. 

Amazing game, a breath of fresh air for the MOBA genre. Wife and I put hundreds of hours in as a duo. Every character felt different and over the first year or two game felt better and better.

However, it just didn't have the audience League did and Blizzard wanted another E-Sport. So they basically abandoned it - but not until their efforts at E-Sport levels of balance made the game far blander and less fun for casual players than before (but still not balanced). 

Starcraft 2: Coop

Yeah. SC2 is an oldie but the incredible 2man mode with a slew of fun commanders and different missions was...just so much fun.

But nothing gold can stay.

Marvel Heroes. 

Game was really getting good, but apparently devs ran out of money/had their license pulled and so, right after the long awaited Omega patch that would have solved just a ton of issues with the game, including meh itemization, servers closed and game is gone forever.

Marvel's Avengers. 

May be the reason why the above got nuked, maybe not. Regardless, amazingly campaign mode, tons of potential - but decided that it would rather have been a bad Live Service game than a good solo game with multiplayer elements and eventually just died.

Outriders.

Liked this game on release, but it had HUGE problems. Crap balance, wonky difficulty, terrible timer based endgame. Much of which was fixed over time.

Then they added the absolutely brilliant Worldslayer expansion, with something that was basically a single player raid instance that may be the finest concept for an endgame I'd in ages.

Reddit,"My Super Meat Boy experience There has been a lotta criticism and collective MEH directed at Super Meat Boy, a game I had preordered and was looking quite forward to. Over the last few hours I can safely report this criticism is totally unfounded by people who must have played simply a demo, watched a video, or just plain want to bitch.

I started off charmed by the visuals, impressed by the soundtrack, and totally pissed that a game that whispers to me that joystick is better (and it really is) only supports one joystick. WTF Team Meat? Anyways after fiddling with 360 controller emulator with little hassle I dove right in.

The first couple levels were obvious tutorial types that would elicit the type of meh I've been hearing of. Whatever. There's a par of 3-5 seconds on these and you have to go out of your way to die, so 15 seconds to learn a game is a pretty small learning curve. 

I loved the small nods to EVERY FUCKING GAME EVER MADE *exaggeration* such as the over world to SMB3, the space background for metroid, zelda for the [dark world](/spoiler), gameboy graphics for secret world and so forth. Reminded me of Scott Pilgrim without the hipster. (<flashy star> BTW I love S.P. VS W)

I was feeling high and mighty thinking I'm just a super good gamer when around the end of the world I noticed the progression percentage wasn't where it should be - suddenly [dark world](/spoiler) I realized everything til then had been a tutorial! I went through spending 10-15 minutes on a par 10-15 second (I'm sort of a completionist)
 

This is the first time in a long time I felt I was learning something new. When Mega Man 9 came out I already had the skills needed to do well, I just needed to apply them (from MM2) With Meat Boy I had to learn a new engine. I soon realized [that running at a wall and holding it for a moment slid me up the wall a bit. - momentum -](/spoiler)  I learned [jumping w/o holding run is different then holding.](/spoiler) I discovered new gaming things on my own which I hadn't done in generations and felt great.


I also noticed an incredibly balanced fairness to SMB. The game went deeper and harder when I wanted it to in regard to difficulty. I'd find a hidden world or something which led to a harder challenge with optional harder challenges within hidden hard world. The game kept on giving when I kept asking. Another neat thing in regards to fairness was everytime I died (often) The whole level reset. This is a subtle detail, but allowed for me to make par very fair - the saw blade would be in the same place every time. The levels didn't seem to change either. Saw blades were on equal timers which didn't make them go out of sync in wacky times. This was helpful in shedding the frustration because I could blame absolutely nothing on anyone/thing but me... I also progressed better.

The achievements aren't given out without actually achieving something. I felt really accomplished when getting them and the game also grants leeway for one to set their own personal achievements and break them as well.


The game is really great and I did my best to convey my experience thus far without spoiling anything. I spent 40-50 dollars on new steam games for thanksgiving, but this is the only one I'm currently playing. It's my #2 for GOTY second only to Amnesia... I recommend it and I wish the best for Team Meat. (but seriously patch that fucking 360 joystick shit)

Reddit,"Do you think there will be any news about more Armored Core content on 6/21 qhen Elden Ring's DLC drops or do you think it's just a fun reference? Saw a comment on a post about ""same ten questions every week"" so I figured to offer a new question. With the lack of balance or new parts in the latest patch for Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, players are wondering what's in store next.

I think they'll stick to their old formula and rather than make any true DLC like Elden Ring, we'll get a 6.5 which carries over parts, save data, and builds while adding new missions, parts, fights, etc. ",0.7783
Reddit,"Ultimatum before i quit BF2042  Dev's or decision makers wont read this, i'll post this anyways.

After having spend well over 250hrs in the game, grinding multiple T1 skins and ranks for Gadgets, weapons, Specialist etc. After grinding to lvl S0028 (which isnt the highest i have seen), i have enough.

If they dont bring a major update coming march im gone. And by that i mean major performance fixes, balancing, content, visual stuff and so on.

I have been trashing this game since its release, and yet i kept playing despite massive rage attacks because of broken shit. I truly believe there is a good game laying somehwere underneath this mess. We can feel it, it just needs to be brought to daylight. I kept playing because - as we all know, give them sometime and eventually it'll be a somewhat good game.

But then i realized one thing; this is a live service game. And idea of live service is not to go radio silent, infact its quite the opposite. Open communications, constant patches, hotfixes, updates this and that. None of that has happened here. So not only did they mess up the game, the franchise - no they also dont seem to know what live service is. And im tired of it.

I'll keep playing until march, and i'll keep trashing this game online until march as well. Because its my right as costumer having spend money on this.

Why i post this here? Because i cant post anything in r/battlefield2042 anymore, and i had to vent. Sorry.",-0.6635
Reddit,"I've been ''aging'' games that I want to play and it's been an fantastic experience. We live a time where people jump on the hype train the moment a game's out and for a long time I did the same as well. Games like Fallout 4, Witcher 3 etc., I was there all for them on day one.

However, like many people I find day one experiences to be mostly buggy and unbalanced, it's been bothering me but never enough to deter me from not jumping the day one train. Until one day I choose to replay Witcher 3 again 2 years after its launch and realized just how insanely polished it's become compared to the launch version, it actually made me regret playing it day one knowing a lot of bugs and issues I had with the game are nowhere to be seen after 2 years. The same thing happened to me when I replay Bloodborne as well, the post Old Hunters DLC version is so much more polished and balanced than the day one version.

That's when I realized: Almost every game that I loved on day one, I would've loved them even more on day 365.

So I started to play games months, even years after its release, and my experience with gaming have been a lot more positive since. Take BFV for example, a Battlefield game riddled with issues and incomplete content since launch, turned out to be a great experience for me because I played it in 2021 instead of late 2018 when it was released. It is truly a game changer, everything becomes so much more enjoyable if you just let them get fixed & polished.

Being patient really pays off in a time when AAA games are being rushed right out of the gate and then fixed & polished months later. It's something that all of you should consider trying. I mean just look at Cyberpunk 2077, would you rather play the current version, or the day one version? You can only experience a game for the first time ONCE so why waste it on a shitty day one build?

I haven't even bought Elden Ring and I'm a huge FromSoftware fanboy. In fact this is the first time I've ever skipped a FromSoftware launch. Not because I wasn't hyped for Elden Ring (my god I was hyped) but because I want to play it when it's at its best.

The Recent 1.03 patch for Elden Ring added NPC tracker on map as well as fixing broken OP weapons kind of proves my point that patience pays off. I can't wait for Elden Ring when it's fully aged like a fine wine.

TL;DR - Instead of playing Cyberpunk 2077 day one cause ''OMG HYPE!!'' it will serve you much better to play it a year later instead. Playing a game on day one is like moving into a house that's still being painted and decorated, yes it's still a functioning house but why not wait for a year and then enjoy a much more refined living experience?",0.9972
Reddit,"People who've played Fallout 76: should I eventually get in on the game? Ever since playing Fallout 3 I've been a Nuka Cola loving Wastelander ever since. I'm relieved after hearing the fallout (tee-hee) of Bethesda's latest game that I didn't purchase it right away; I had reservations already considering it was multi-player exclusive. But with all games of this type, patches and updates eventually follow and the game gameplay wise should balance out.

In your opinion, should I get in on Fallout 76? Aside from the bugs which I assume will eventually be patched how is it otherwise? Are players a reasonable amount of toxic versus say, an average CoD lobby. How's overall functionality and mechanics? I kinda want to give it a chance but I'm not sure.

Reddit,"What is your most unpopular, witch-hunt inducing opinion/fact about a game? Mine?

""Competitive"" Smash is a fucking joke.

* Almost every one of your ""pro"" players is garbage at every other fighting game
* Your game is quantifiably provable as an imbalanced, heavily tiered monstrosity at all levels of play.
* The guy in charge of balancing blatantly (and, again, provably) plays horrendous favorites (Rosalina been at/near the top of the charts literally since release while Greninja gets major, playstyle-changing nerfs every single patch?)
* You had to skip a game in your series with only 4 iterations because it tried to be what the series was INTENDED to be instead of a competitive fighter
* You have a ridiculous amount of clone characters, and either A) they're basically cookie-cutter clones (Pit/Dark Pit) or B) the clone is outright superior in 8/10 areas (Marth/Roy)
* Your fanbase's go-to as the ""best smash bros"" version is usually supplemented by fan-made balancing, modding, or rules because it's so fundamentally flawed as a ""competitive"" fighter. 

Seriously, every single time I meet someone who thinks they're hot shit at fighting games and then says ""oh I only play smash"", I instantaneously think they spent the first 20 years of their life eating paste.



So that's mine, what's yours? No holds barred, what's the thing that is probably going to earn you an endless string of massive hate in your comment chain?

Final Fantasy 7 was garbage?
Last of Us is one of the most predictable/boring games of last/this generation?

If you're gonna release a game unfinished, why the fuck do they not patch it ASAP??? That's the first thing you do. TT Games, I don't care AT ALL about DLC characters. Fix your game first. Fromsoft, I don't want to play your game if you only make half of it.

Reddit,"2010-2018 is the golden era of First person shooters I believe first person shooters peaked from 2010-2018. Those games came out polished, somewhat balanced, and just seems more complete than the games we get today. Call of duty black ops, battlefield 3, MW3, battle field 4, syndicate. These games either had great story, great gameplay, and had hours of fun. I’m not saying they were perfect because obviously they had their bugs, glitches, and what not but damn it, with the over reliance of day 1 patches and massive “updates” to implement cut content due to crunch constraints, I dont see any improvement upon games releasing. Not unless the developers take the amount of time they need in order to release the game that they make. Hindsight is 20/20 and the fact we have so many “remake and remasters” flooding the market it shows a lack of creativity, and hopefully we get to see some really cool stuff or we are doomed to repeat what we have already played.",0.7722
Reddit,"What's a concern or game mechanic that is a common pet peeve for most gamers but doesn't bother you very much? For me, the two things that come to mind are unbalanced characters/weapons etc in multiplayer games, and random encounters in RPGs.

As for balancing, I've found that most of the time the effects of the overpowered thing are usually not that detrimental to overall play, and often times the resulting patches totally overcorrect for it. Often times the ""unbalanced"" abilities actually serve to make the overall game have more dynamism and variety, since they force players to actually change their strategy and ensure a tangible difference between choices that the players make. good example of this is many of the guns in cod4. some guns like the m16, mp5, deagle and m40a3 are objectively better than many of their counterparts, and others, such as the shotguns, lower level SMGs and LMGs are by most metrics worse than the average gun. this combined with the map design actually forces players to switch the guns that they're using depending on the situation, rather than having 30 weapons that all have relatively comparable damage and can be used on every map. 

even though i don't play RPGs very often at all, whenever i do play games such as ff7 and pokemon i never really have a big issue with persistent random encounters. if the combat system is fun enough, i can stomach the grinding.",0.9357
Reddit,"OSWoW | Custom Vanilla🍦 Project | Launching new realm 16th Feb 16:00 GMT+1 ###Old School WoW is set to launch a new realm on the 16th of Feb 16:00 GMT+1! The project has been in developement for almost 3 years and we wish to extend our thanks to everyone that helped us out during the developement stage!

NOTE: All characters created on your account during the first week of the new realm being launched will get a free 10 slot Azure Rucksack.

In addition to that, the first 25 players to reach level 40 on the new realm will recieve a unique companion, the Azure Whelpling.

##So here are the answers to some FAQs:

Is there a fully released timeline?

- [Yes!](https://i.imgur.com/qXw5NtC.png)

Does this project have a discord server?

- [Yes!](https://discord.gg/k8JKdQGtPn)

Which client version do you need?

- Any 1.12.1 game client will do; you can find one on our website if you already do not have one.

Will you have to download some sort of mandatory custom launcher or custom client?

- No, all you will need is our small custom patch (currently less than 5 megabytes) and to set your realmlist to ours. Any standard 1.12.1 vanilla client will do.

What rates will the server have at launch?

- 1.25x kill xp. 1.5x elite kill, reputation, crafting professions and weapon/defence skill gains. 1.75x quest xp, and 4x exploration xp. 2.0x rested rate inside taverns & cities.
- Mobs & Bosses will have 20% more health and 10% more damage to compensate for the changes on the server making the game feel less challenging and dangerous.
- To compensate for leveling so fast and not having as much gold as you should at different levels, all weapon skill & spell training costs are cut in half.

Realm type?

- PvP.

Will the debuff cap be increased?

- Yes, it has been increased to 40 but you will still only be able to see 16 of them being displayed.

Will there be any changes to world buffs?

- World buffs will not be allowed inside raids and battlegrounds. Songflower Serenade and Diremaul buffs will no longer be dispellable.
- Current flasks have been taken out of the game and will be available during a later phase of the game. Instead a weaker version of the current flasks have been introduced that will be obtainable from the current ones used to be obtainable from. These flasks will be easier to conjure as well as they will not require a Black Lotus to make.

Will you have reworked racials?

- Yes, we have reworked all the racials.

Will you have reworked classes?

- Yes, we will! Most specs have already been reworked. This means both baseline changes to the classes and changes to talents. There will also be new class quests to enjoy! To see the current changes to classes, you can check out our [talent calculator](https://talentcalculator.oswow.net/) and our [changelog](https://oswow.net/en/changelogs). Note that not all specializations are mostly finished (Survival Hunter, Demonology & Destruction Lock) and so have more changes coming up for them than other specializations.

Will you have retuned content such as raids and dungeons?

- Yes.

What is the plan for PvP on launch?

- You will gain honor and rank up during launch to not have low-level pvp & world pvp feel dead and have it so that you may face dangers along the road. However, you cannot rank past rank 11 upon release. So Epic PvP gear will be released once the next two raid tiers are out.
- RP decay will only be 8% (20% in retail vanilla/classic).
- WSGs and ABs will be available at launch.
- PvP gear earned from ranking (so not reputation rewards) will now have resilience. Resilience is a completely new custom stat that grants players flat percentage damage reduction against other players and their pets/controlled units (I.E., 1%, 2%, 3%...).
- PvP objectives in Eastern Plaguelands will be available at launch but not in Silithus.
- Our unique crossfaction BG system will also be enabled on launch to keep low level BG brackets active until most of the player base has reached level 60 which at that point we will disable it.
- Ontop of that, Doing BGs also grants you XP upon completing them. The XP is based on the amount of honor gained.

There will be more to come such as new custom BGs and reworking the PvP gear and new world PvP objectives etc.

Will AoE farming be nerfed?

- A lot of spells (basically all unless we have missed any) has been changed to start spreading the damage across targets when hitting more than 15 targets, instead of doing more overall damage. This means you will not be able to pull entire dungeons and deal damage to all of them with AoE spells, this however does not apply to effects that causes damage when targets hit you (I.E. Thorns, Retribution Aura) nor AoE damage from items or consumeables. Frost Mages have also had Permafrost and Improved Blizzard slightly nerfed.

Any changes to talent respecing?

- Yes, the talent respec cost multiplier has been reduced to 2 gold, down from 5 gold. I.E., 1/5/10/15/...50 gold -> 1/2/4/6/...20 gold.

Any changes to items?

- Tier sets for hybrid classes will have a better stat budget. Tier sets with bad tier bonuses will also have their tier bonuses buffed to promote people finishing the look and gaining all pieces of the puzzle. The bonuses shall reward the effort! 
- Items with bad proc effects will get buffed and classes such as warriors have been reworked in such a way so that fast weapons like Blackfury are good and so a slower attack speed would not make you noticeably stronger. This should give players a lot more options to choose from.
- There will be new tier sets being added to the tiers post tier 1, meaning each class will have at least 2 tier sets per new tier being released. This could, for example, be feral druids getting a tanking set and balance/resto getting a hybrid set.

Any changes to professions?

- Yes, so far Blacksmithing and Mining has been completely reworked, other professions to soon follow suit as well. This includes new items, recipes, item sets, new features, and changes to pre-existing items and recipes as well.

Is there a cash shop?

- No, there will be one in the future, but it would only ever contain cosmetic rewards. No P2W will ever be introduced.

Multiboxing? Griefing? Corpse camping someone endlessly until they quit?

- Straight to jail.

Is it possible to create an account already?

- Yes, visit our [account creation](https://oswow.net/) page.

Is there a connection guide?

- Yes, both on the [website](https://oswow.net/) and on our [discord](https://discord.gg/k8JKdQGtPn).

If you have any more questions. You can visit our [website](https://oswow.net/) or join our [discord](https://discord.gg/k8JKdQGtPn) channel.",0.9957
Reddit,"The Elder Scrolls Online is GOOOOD. If you are on the fence about ESO or if all you've heard is negative comments/reviews from months ago, you are missing out.  With yesterday's update, this feels like a whole new game.

ESO is a unique gaming experience incorporating gameplay elements from GW2, DAOC and even Skyrim.  The crafting system is one of a kind and maybe the most fun element of the entire game.

The PVP system has been upgraded and is even better than before.  Class balancing patches are being rolled out almost weekly, but I've never seen a nerf bat.

The future of the game is even brighter, the justice system will add more player choice and playstyle customization options.  The provisioning crafting system is getting an overhaul soon too.

I know the $15 monthly fee feels antiquated and expensive, but these guys have added more functionality, improvements and player customization in the last 3 months than WoW did in it's first year.

It's not too late.  Get it on Steam and come try it out.  You won't regret it.

TL;DR

ESO is much improved since launch.  Buy it now.",0.9817

Reddit,"The gold old days of quality games....(btw sorry for the rant post) So is it just me or has the quality of AAA games seem to have gone down over the past few years? Like when was the last AAA game that was made that didnt have a day 1 patch or additional ""DLC"" that was an add-on but was really just a way to get more money for finishing a game. 

Maybe it's an unpopular opinion but would you rather a complete finished and semi-polished game to start even if it wasnt completely balanced or would you rather pay for a game that has so much in it that it just never feels complete and constantly needs patches, balancing, DLC, etc.

Maybe it's just because I broke out some of my n64 and GC era games recently and had a nostalgia overload but I just think back to games like double dash, goldeneye and smash bros through brawl and think yea i paid $X.XX and got a game that I played forever and ever and didnt have to pay for extra content or complain about a weapon set being over powered or what I tend to find in just about any game a specific ""meta"" combination that only has obscure counters that only work against that particular set up.

Back in my day the only meta you had to worry about was metaknight in brawl lol but now different games that I play you just cant play the way you like and still have fun.....warzone constantly has a meta class like the DMR/diamatti set up and ur usual loadoats just cant compare. I play clash royale on mobile and theres a meta deck that maybe swaps out 1 or 2 cards for something more to the players play style but me I have used the same deck that I started with since the beginning 4 years ago and still tend to do above average but cant stand playing against the same set up for each opponent. Then of course theres certain games where there literally is no choice but to follow the meta for having any chance of winning.

I just miss the days of running to Toys R Us, going to the video game zone and buying my games coming home and having a completed game to start(minus some glitches/bugs/etc.) That were normal and nowhere near as bad as modern bugs or glitches. Goldeneye had odd job- nobody liked playing against that person but there were counters that didnt completely change the game or change the way u had to play. All smash games have an OP or meta level player but to unleash that typically took skill or there was a counter strategy in other characters(jigglypuff in SSB was pretty OP if you could master her) but took skill or you learn what that OP characters weakness is and work your strategy to the advantage. Just reminds me of how my brother always played as samus and would wreck from a distance, just meant I had to learn a better close contact fighting or when he was DK had to get better control of Ness's PK thunder to keep him at a distance.

Maybe I'm just ranting, maybe im just older and have become a shittier gamer, or maybe I just am old and crotchety and dont like change but if you ask me I would rather a GC or even Wii level graphics game that's complete, doesnt need constant updates and always has a way to make you keep on paying for it.",0.979
