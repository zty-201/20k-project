I've legit never seen a worse year in a company's history. Which makes me especially sad because Riot started off on such a strong foot and I still want the game to do well.

It's really worrying to see the direction they're going in, and I hope Riot get's their shi together next year.

Reddit,General Balance Feedback,balance issues,leagueoflegends,"ADCs have become so team dependent that the Ryze/Azir/Kalista balancing issues are now applied to the entire ADC role, good in professional play but horrendous in solo queue.","ADCs have become so team dependent that the Ryze/Azir/Kalista balancing issues are now applied to the entire ADC role, good in professional play but horrendous in solo queue. Aside from Kalista now becoming a top laner, these champions have notoriously been incredibly difficult to balance between pro play and solo q. We are now seeing this with the entire ADC where in pro play they seem to perform well with a coordinated team around them and much less likelihood of a team getting so dumpstered it's ff15. But in solo queue, well no one wants to play this role. ADC mains are just plainly switching role, it's impossible to play and climb with ADC because you have no guarantee that your team will let you even play the game. Carrying with ADC in solo queue is impossible, you need your team to already be doing well for you to get to impact the game, and if your team is already doing well you probably were going to win anyway.

The changes in 10.8 of buffing Ashe, Trist, and Xayah and nerfing Aphelios, Senna, Varus and Kalista will only affect pro-play. The top solo q ADCs will continue to be roughly the same in concept, maximising impact on the game by having one purpose that is almost impossible to fail at. Either lethality Varus and poking from a screen away, MF and just hitting R in a teamfight, or the upcoming utility Ashe focused around CDR for ult. There is almost no room for skill expression within this role, the best ADCs just need to hit their one button before dying. Kiting, dodging in teamfights, peeling the ADC from bruisers, concepts that are now all gone. Picking an ADC that has some expression of skill through mechanical movement and precise teamfighting is pointless and will continue to be pointless until the entire game gets rebalanced. As long as every role can 1v1 ADCs and that games are decided within 15 minutes (usually leading to 15-20 min FF), the solo queue ADC meta will be as stale as ever, with a select few ADCs who are barely playable, and everything else as trash.

Edit: I don't like the proposed fixes of ""nerf all supports"" or ""buff all ADCs across the board"" since they usually create more problems than they fix, like ADCs moving to top or mid. My ideas for some fixes are in [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fwep4f/adcs_have_become_so_team_dependent_that_the/fmo6i3r/) below.",2505,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fwep4f/adcs_have_become_so_team_dependent_that_the/,1586236918.0,0.9821

Completely ignoring various complex situations that could arise: 

- You could be in a teamfight in which you do not have the time to type ""Karthus Ult"" while for example chasing, disengaging, anticipating flanks, and so on (you rather want to conveniently press Tab > ping the Ult)

- There are many players who have their chat muted since they do not want to experience the toxicity and blaming that is going on, rather focusing on the game itself (So, how you gonna tell that Karthus to Ult, should I spam my pings in his face so that he certainly won't think that I am flaming him?)

It just shows that Phreak, whom I have nothing against since I think that he gets too much heat for just by being a popular figure in the Balance Team, instead of thinking in-depth about the negatives of the ping changes, which are obviously stifiling necessary communication in a team game; rather, he is doubling down with such an oversimplified, contemptuous reaction statement towards criticism. 

The player base is not able to properly communicate in a video game that is team based to the core, and instead of creating a safe space for everybody and everything, we should rather find solutions that do not restrict its most crucial communication tools, but rather combat the real issues why there is so much in-game misbehaviour. 

And this boils down to an easy answer that has a very simple, but telling message: 

""I can mute your chat and pings, but I can not mute you from running it down and therefore ruining peoples games."" 

These negative behaviours occur because of the years of neglience towards the issues by not actually barring players from Ranked Mode who run it down, rage quit, intentional feed, and therefore nearly always getting away with it while ruining countless other games along the way. And the only ""revenge"", if you can call it that, is the community then using profane language and abusing communication tools to somehow get their frustration out since for years you guys are not doing anything about it in the first place!",14014,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17r2bwb/phreak_stating_that_you_can_type_karthus_ult/,1699495721.0,-0.9778
Reddit,General Balance Feedback,balance issues,leagueoflegends,Naafiri hasn't even reached one year on the rift and she already became the least picked champion in the game,"Naafiri hasn't even reached one year on the rift and she already became the least picked champion in the game [Ziggs mid is less popular but if you combine both Ziggs bot and Ziggs mid, their pickrate is higher than Naafiri](https://preview.redd.it/2psz0nu2ys1d1.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0725c6ee3c8d2889a80b76f07150d746401132e)

Naafiri is a good case on what Riot should avoid in champion design

**1- The end goal was terrible**

*“A while back, our champion design lead, August Browning, did an analysis of our whole roster and categorized each champ by role, class, and difficulty in order to find some opportunity areas for players,” game designer Glenn “Riot Twin Enso” Anderson reveals. “He ended up finding two major holes: a higher skill tank, which ended up being K’Sante, and a relatively simple and beginner-friendly assassin, which became Naafiri.”” -  Naafiri champ insights June 2023*

These were a bit of flawed goals, Tank like K'Sante having so much agency forces him to be permanently bound to being highest presence in pro play despite multiple adjustments, nerfs and reworks so he has to remain as 45% WR while an assassin with literally no skill ceiling gets dropped by mid lane players almost immediately and thus have an abysmal pickrate

**2-""Monster champions have low pickrate"" was used as an excuse to not follow up on Naafiri's post release**

Naafiri was in fact just a check box, community kept asking for a monster champions and Riot wanted to fill the gap in their roster so they just checked both boxes, released the filler champ and moved on to the next project.

They didn't stop to think that maybe the brand new easy/intro champion should at the very minimum have same pickrate as other niche assasins as players should find immediate success when they pick her up

Sure, there is truth to it, if Naafiri had a model that looked like the other darkin champions but female, she would have had higher pickrate but there are also tons of monster champions who are faring well in terms of popularity with much older kits and worse looking models.

**3-Naafiri should have been allowed to jungle**

I can understand why not let her jungle at the first month or two as to push her identity as a mid laner or solo laner but once the dust settled down and mid laners voted with their pickrate  that they don't want to play this absolutely boring kit, Riot should have immediately given some jungle ratios and see how she would fare in the jungle

Riot literally buffed Sylas, Olaf, Zyra, Brand, Sett and others to push them to jungle and attract more pickrate for these champions, but the least popular champion in the game isn't looked at?

I don't see any reason why Naafiri shouldn't have been allowed to jungle, Junglers are more likely to pick up monster champions. If Naafiri would be problematic and very frustrating jungler and get +30% banrate then sure remove her jungle modifiers but at the very least give it a shot and see if her dwindling playerbase would recover from its death spiral

**4- Her kit has an identity issue as she plays like a skirmisher rather than an assassin**

-her engage ability \[W\] is a point and dash that has long channel time and can be blocked by other enemies standing in its path so her back line access is pretty shit specially the higher in MMR you go and enemy team has that knowledge. Diana E for example has the same range of Naafiri until Naafiri hits lvl 11 but she has no cast time and other champions can't block it

the cast time of W gives too much counterplay, any champion with an ounce of hard CC can easily interrupt Naafiri mid dash \[Hwei EQ, Syndra E, Lux Q, etc\]  compare that to the instanteous Diana dash's case where the enemy mid laner has to predict that Diana will dash and throw his CC early to stop Diana mid dash

-she has no escape tools but to compensate she gets shields from her R + on her take downs as well

-The bleed in her kit synergizes with Black Cleaver and Eclipse \[Fighter items\]

-So is she a good skirmisher? not really, she lacks any form of CC whether slows or hard CC, that greatly diminishes her skirmishing

**5- The kit has nothing to master and the narrative is disconnected from the gameplay**

shes literally a nothing burger, she has no skill expression and she gets boring after the third game as her gameplay loop gets very repetitive and boring.

her E is the only redeeming ability in her kit as she dishes out damage at start of the dash and then at the end of the dash, she deals even more damage in an explosion but the fun thing about the abilitiy is that it immediately recalls your dogs and heals them up

her R is you get more dogs and bonus AD + shield, the cool part is that the dogs get a small boost in HP so they could survive getting one shot, I like that part

the champion theme is the pack and half her voice lines are all about unity and how the pack makes her strong and that a lone dog is weak, etc. etc.

where is that pack in her gameplay???

why don't her abilities get some twists depending on how many dogs she has? doesn't have to be more or less numbers in her damage, what makes Naafiri unique from the other 166 champions? its her pack gimmick and nothing else.

**Naafiri has the tools in her kit to protect and heal her pack and but she is punished for protecting her pups as she blows her mana, damage and her cooldown for literally  no gain**

to reiterate, I don't say Naafiri should have been a high skill floor champion but there are lots of champions that have low skill floor and are newbie friendly but also moderate to high skill ceiling to encourage players to main them and not get bored after a few games.

**Closing notes:**

its a shame how Naafiri turned out, her in game model is cool and very different from your average league champion, the dogs AI is smart and I love that they can help you CS and they move smoothly around you, her R animation and sound really sells the whole unleash the pack vibe, the animators, riggers, vfx artists all did a wonderful job.

but the gameplay is horrendous and she is doomed to be the lowest pickrate champ in the game unless she's balanced around having 52% WR and  her pickrate will still be bottom 20 as you can't bribe players with winrate to play this boring ass champion

No other newly released champion in League's history had their pickrate plummet this quickly and sharply after their release

to understand how bad Naafiri pickrate is, it took Rell \~2 years after her release to get the midscope rework and Rell's pickrate pre midscope was higher than current Naafiri.",4058,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1cxdux0/naafiri_hasnt_even_reached_one_year_on_the_rift/,1716313430.0,0.9987
Reddit,General Balance Feedback,balance issues,leagueoflegends,"Aatrox's Core Balancing Issue, His Identity Crisis","Aatrox's Core Balancing Issue, His Identity Crisis Hey guys, it's Domasis, the guy [who posted the undocumented Aatrox nerfs earlier today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d20xsb/_/) I'm here to discuss Aatrox and how he has been played since his Rework.

**TL;DR**: Riot is mistaken about Aatrox's class, and therefore balance philosophy. Aatrox is not a Juggernaut, he's a Diver, and he needs to be approached balance-wise from that regard.

I initially started this conversation over at r/TheAatroxMains, but I decided I'd come to the main sub to make my case known here as well.

As you know, Aatrox was reworked to better deliver on the fantasy of [a Darkin Warlord,](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/10/champion-roadmap-october-2017/) and as [a greatsword duelist that relentlessly pursues his foes.](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2018/04/champion-roadmap-april-2018/) With the rework's release, we were presented with an atypical Juggernaut, one that bypassed most of a traditional Juggernaut's weaknesses.

To recap quickly what a Juggernaut's traits traditionally are, Juggernauts:

* *Are generally immobile*

* *Can be kited easily*

* *Have limited CC*

* **Have immense damage resulting in kill threat when you're in their radius**

* *Are generally very tanky*

* **Either have inbuilt sustain or ways to survive in drawn out fights.**

Here's what Aatrox has:

* **Large quantities of CC**

* Extremely high damage

* **Terrain Scaling**

* **Multiple Sources of Mobility**, making him **difficult to kite** at times

* **Sustain**

* Tankiness as a byproduct of his sustain

* **A reset mechanic akin to a Skirmisher, not a Juggernaut**


---
Very quickly, the issues present themselves. Aatrox is classified as a Juggernaut, but doesn't have Juggernaut weaknesses. What he does have, however, is a good chunk of Diver strengths. To recap, this is what a diver is described as:

Divers are the **more mobile portion** of the Fighter class. Divers excel at **singling out high-priority targets to blitz toward**, immediately forcing those targets (and their teammates) to deal with the diver’s presence. **Divers are not as durable** as the tanks or juggernauts of the world, but Divers can take their fair share of punishment **while bringing enough damage to be a real kill threat if left unchecked**.

So essentially Divers:

* Are mobile (high movement speed counts as mobile for those wondering about Olaf)

* Can access a high priority target easily

* Have access to immense damage

* Have tools to survive for a while once they've accessed the backline

* Have no CC minimums or caps, leading to a wide range of CC in the class (Vi with the most, Olaf with the least).

* Generally have low cooldowns (Riven, Pantheon, Vi, Warwick, Xin Zhao, Renekton, and Lee Sin all come to mind)

* Force the enemy to turn and focus them

So guess what? **Aatrox literally fits the textbook definition of a Diver while being classified as a Juggernaut.** He has mobility, he has terrain scaling, immense damage, tools to survive (World Ender + Umbral Dash's combined sustain), a large assortment of CC (which fits in the Diver class), and relatively low cooldowns as he builds CDR, like all of the other Divers.

It's his biggest balancing issue, and it NEEDS to be addressed when they rework him after Worlds. The pros value his Juggernaut levels of tankiness, his high kill threat at all phases of the game, his damage, his waveclear (which they just gutted), his Juggernaut levels of teamfight impact when he gets rolling, but they also value his mobility, his Diver levels of CDs and CC, and the sustain he brings in addition to all the other traits.


**He's a King of Fighters, with the tools to back it up.**


They can't give him Juggernaut weaknesses because he has Diver strengths, which are in direct opposition to the Juggernaut weaknesses. Rather, they need to **give him Diver weaknesses** and do away with this perfect combination of traits, cementing him as the Diver he plays as, **or actually give him Juggernaut weaknesses.**


At the end of the day, Riot has to deal with a **Juggernaut** who is more of a **Diver**, but isn't being balanced as such. When Riot plans to revisit him after 9.19, I hope they aim to treat him as a part of the class he **actually plays like** instead of the class **they arbitrarily put him into**.

Reddit,General Balance Feedback,balance issues,leagueoflegends,Warwick Changes were a mistake 14.22,"Warwick Changes were a mistake 14.22 So, as a Warwick main that has played the champion almost everyday for 7 years with around 4000 hours, and being one of the best Warwick players in the world I can safely say

Warwick is clunkier than ever

His hitbox changes were made in 14.9 from 55-65, making him lose his slippery yordle hitbox and now with the recent changes his model size got increased by 15%, but the thing about Warwick is his base stats are trash. Other champions like Illaoi, Olaf and Urgot make sense since their base stats are very high and they are not easy to kill. Warwicks main counterplay to this weakness is his E which has a high dmg reduction but a high cooldown meaning you peel/stay alive for long. So either reverse the changes to what they were or give us better stats.

Warwick Q hasn't even gotten touched despite the fact that it's probably the buggiest ability in the game rn, sometimes acting like a hold when tapping or vice versa, not avoiding knock ups during it's animations, sometimes the ability goes on cd when enemies walk into bushes making you lose mana and deal no dmg thus healing nada.

Warwick W changes have not even been mentioned in the patch notes and it is now showing the wrong information, it mentioned that abilities will now be able to proc the AS from W and the AS lingers for 1 sec which at first would make any ww main go ""Oh, so they make Warwick play smoother"". Nope, what they instead did is they made Warwick W not give any attack speed at all in the first hit, making his farming under turret extremely vulnerable, waveclear feels clunky, and trading shortly with champions has become an actual pain. And his W attack speed and movement speed bonuses have decreased, they no longer triple when targets get below 20%, they now only double when enemies get below 25%. But still holding onto hope we thought we were getting our out of combat ms work in combat to not get cancelled by enemy champions unless we are the ones to hit them, that is how it was in pbe, that is how it is in the tooltip, but no it isn't there.

Warwick E lock out getting halved from 0.5 to 0.25 is a placebo buff, in reality, you can actually cancel the animation of E2 by simply Q'ing and then using E2 right after. But if you decide to try that now you will instead be greeted by one of Warwicks Q bugs that made his Q act like a hold no matter how lightly and fast you will tap the ability, but now that bug skyrocketed increasing the chance of that to happening from about 10-20% to about 80-90% test it in practice tool.

Warwick R changes, this is a mixed bag for me as it is nice to have your ultimate finally not have the width of Yasuo Q anymore (I wish I was joking) 80 vs 100 units of width on Warwick R that is now 150. They also removed the Warwick R hitbox at the back, which is a good change that adds skill expression and makes Warwick good at fleeing instead of hitting the enemies that are touching the tip of your tail. But they went absolutely overboard with it as champions that are right up your a#& or inside of you, will not get hit by the Warwick ultimate unless your cursor is directly on top of them. It also seems that for the few frames of jumping you cannot actually hit stuff making it very easy to miss your ultimate when a champion is directly next to you

But anyway I would simply like to say that these arcane season 2 ""buffs"" need to get reverted, they have made Warwick. A champion that has already felt extremely clunky even clunkier than before.

So I would like to give my opinions on what the Warwick changes should look like

1. I think Warwick should get straight up buffs without any nerfs to his kit, I'm not gonna lie Warwick is extremely weak in the jungle and he is not that strong top lane (unless you abuse barrier in diamond). I think it is kind of disgusting for Warwick to get AD/AP scaling to his passive 4 years ago due to him obviously falling out of meta, and 1 year ago we got buffs to his Q dealing extra damage to monsters, and W getting less cd and more ms, since Warwick jungle was actually pathetic at the time compared to every other jungler that can waveclear 3x times as fast whether it's a single camp like gromp, or the you will need to buy tiamat for this aka raptors.
2. Warwick should receive lots of bugfixes, this one is a no brainer as Warwicks spaghetti code has been breaking in lots of places, in this season Warwicks gotten a bug that makes his W not give him any movement speed against low targets whether it's the passive or the active, and it doesn't give you vision of enemies that have walked into bushes, or are recalling in said bushes, this happens about 5-10% of the time now but it is game changing. Warwick Q is getting more inconsistent with every patch. And Warwick E hitbox is still dragging behind harder than Santas ballsack in july when using Q to follow targets thus making your fear miss while latching onto a target that has used a blink/dash ability.
3. Every champ besides Warwick has received so much love over the years with constant buffs, and mini reworks with minimal if any drawback whatsoever. Like actually go look at champs like Gnar and Kennen that has received like 9 buffs in the past 5 years that were not small by any stretch of the imagination. Fiora, Gragas, Jax, Riven, And recently Irelia have gotten insane buffs to their splitpushing removing any counterplay to them. Bullies like Jayce, Darius, Garen, Renekton, and Urgot have received so many buffs that it is insane. And Warwick has gotten barely any love because we have to think about low elo guys, when champions like Garen and Trundle are 10x worse there. But there is also a fair point when addressing the Warwick top barrier abusers for which I don't think are that problematic when they fall off a cliff after laning phase without teleport, or any good items that actually scale. So I think it's fair to throw the dog a bone every now and then
4. Everyone knows how easy it is to counter Warwick. And People act like he doesn't have any counterplay since they hate Warwick because of 3 things, his early game sustain, his Q latch mechanics that makes everyone mad when they flash and Warwick is still biting their ass, and the barrier abusers on top getting ultra fed early and ending the game because in diamond and below, if you win laning phase you win the game. But I digress, anyway, everyone knows to just buy oblivion orb and Warwick can get easily poked out and die now since everyone one shots the other champ, Warwick W movement speed is out of combat and his base movement speed is 335 meaning if you hit him once he goes 100-0 real quick, usually gets kited, and dies. Warwick R was incredibly easy to dodge since it had a shit hitbox that made every WW main look like a first timer when they miss an ultimate, and what's even funnier, everyone knows how easy it is to cancel Warwick ultimate by yourself with the most basic of abilites, Garen Q, TF stun, Udyr E, Vel'koz E, Hwei fear, Fiddle Q/E, Cho'gath Q/W, Darius E ect. Champions with long windup animations can time their abilities at the last moment to just shrug off Warwick by themselves, which is something riot has actually removed in the past, when every Singed player started using E on Warwick and always flipped them out of their ult, just check the patch notes.

With that being said I will now go over the Warwick buff that I believe our doggo deserves

How to actually fix Warwick (Don't add all of these changes just some of them except for bug fixes)

\- Reduce Warwicks hitbox and size to what it used to be since Warwicks base stats suck, or increase his base stats... a lot

\- Increase Warwicks base ms speed by 5 it made sense 7 years ago when champs didnt have 4 dashes, Movement speed buffs, and incredible base stats

\- Make Q deal AOE dmg against monsters

\- Change W movement speed so when you get hit you will lose about 80% of the current movement speed instead of going from 100-0 also it has a 0-3.5 ramp up

\- Make Warwick E deal damage to monsters so that junglers can actually use this ability against camps (active or passive maybe bami cinder mini passive against monsters)

\- Make Warwick R not get cancelled by the enemy champions basic abilites (everyone knows how to counter this now)

\- Make Warwick R cost less mana from 100 to all ranks to 100-50-0 lvl 6-11-16 (Warwick got left behind with the sheen changes and didn't receive buff to his mana 10.23

I believe Warwick jungle takes priority as his waveclear is ass without tiamat, and even with it is lackluster. Warwick top should receive some smaller buffs maybe AD, MS, Ressistances, or HP.

BUG FIXES

HIGH PRIORITY

\- Fix Warwick Q acting like a hold when tapping and vice versa

\- Fix Warwick Q going on cd, losing mana, not dealing dmg, and not healing when enemy targets walk into bushes

\- Fix Warwick Q sometimes getting cc'd by knockups mid animation

\- Fix Warwick W MS so that it doesn't bug out and not give you any movement speed on both passive and activ

\- Fix Warwick E hitbox when Q'ing through targets so it actually hits people around instead of following your model with a delay thus making the fear not hit at all

\- Fix Warwick R so you don't just stand there for 1.5 seconds when a champion uses an orange, Olaf ult, or Qss,(RELEASE ME)

\- Fix Warwick R so that it cannot get cancelled by basic abilites like Garen Q, Darius, E, Fiddle Q/E ect. But it can get cancelled by ultimate abilities like Gragas R, Qyiana R, Malphite R etc ( no idea how they would impliment this but it would be the most fair thing to do IMO) EDIT! I meant basic abilities from the target you are currently ulting not every basic ability, teammates like Rell, and Leona would still be able to cc you out of the target Ww is ulting. That would be really stupid as it would remove counterplay and I'm sorry for causing confusion in the comment threads.

MID PRIORITY

\- Fix Warwick Q healing after you are dead (maybe make it's damage animation speed based on attack speed)

\- Fix Warwick W attack speed for real this time, no need to use tiamat after getting a target low to receive the bonus upon getting enemies below 50% and 20% right after, or pressing S and then clicking on it again, or clicking on ground and then on target

\- Warwick E hitbox being really bad at fearing people behind Warwick (I'm not insane everyone else is)

Anyways this is a lot longer than I thought it would be. Thank you for actually paying attention to the ramblings of a madman, it means a lot. I just feel so disappointed with these changes and wanted to get them off my chest while also adding my reasoning, and thoughts on what Warwick actually needs.

I hope you all have a good day.

Edit: it seems that Warwick is broken in more ways than I even thought, looking at the Warwick main subreddit which is rn overflowing with bugs from the new changes, and every Ww main/player hating these changes (roughly 90% of them) agree that Ww feels more clunky, buggy, and less satisfying overall. With every non ww player/main barely reading this post and typing stuff like ""Finally Warwick is balanced"" and stuff like that. Anyways I would like to thank all of you, even the not so supportive part of community for bringing awareness to this issue.

2nd Edit: the changes have been now live for a while now and it has done exactly what I've feared it would do, Make Warwick a crazy good right clicking stat checker in low elo both in jgl and top (with barrier abusers taking most of the credit), that falls off mid-late game. And absolutely useless in higher levels of play. Warwick has now cemented his fate to always be a right clicking. Barrier Relying. Clunky. Buggy. Stat checker.

Reddit,General Balance Feedback,balance issues,leagueoflegends,Can we call Yuumi's rework a complete failure yet?,"Can we call Yuumi's rework a complete failure yet? So, Riot had an issue with Yuumi wherein this champion they intended to be accessible and simple ended up being very exploitable in pro play, and having an [actually high mastery curve](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/dev/ask-riot-delete-yuumi/) so she wasn't even usable by the intended audience.

They did what they did for a lot of pro tier problem champions in that they reworked her, removing much of her skill expression to bring low tier and high tier Yuumis closer together, and make her less dominant in elite tier without having her winrate being nearly 40% (which it was at her lowest point; after being nerfed right before her rework dropped).

They made it so she no longer has to detach and she's no longer able to switch allies, effectively speaking, by tying her abilities effectiveness into a very clunky best friend mechanic. This removed much of the counterplay of the champion, as she now has zero reason to put herself at risk, while also anchoring her to one person and enforcing her identity as an afk duoQ champ.

In the process of removing all the fun from Yuumi to make her easier, Riot's goal was just to get her out of professional play and into the hands of low elo players who don't wanna move around much and just want to be a cute cat supporting their friends. Did it work?

Absolutely not! Her winrate is still bottom tier because she went right back into pro play and had to be nerfed all over again. And by removing skill expression from the champion, did they make her any easier? I guess, [but her mastery curve is still the 21st in the entire game](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/winrates-by-xp), the closest enchanter to her in difficulty in this sense is Renata Glasc, who is in 44th place. In the lowest elos possible, her winrate has somehow gotten even worse than before and she now sits at almost [40% WR in Iron](https://u.gg/lol/champions/yuumi/build?rank=iron). She is genuinely unplayable for low elo players, both difficult to learn and useless to master because you get no returns from putting in the work.

You basically have to break your back learning to optimize every drop of power from the worst kit in League of Legends in exchange for a mediocre WR with Yuumi, when you could instead just play any other enchanter and do far better.

Trying to balance her around a low skill floor is a terrible idea to begin with, this entire plan was doomed from the start. Yuumi is a role-altering champion who does not teach you the fundamentals of League. Beginner friendly champs always have been, and always will be, fundamentals-only champs, with almost no mechanics unique to them on top of that. Garen, Soraka, these are beginner champions.

Yuumi is more akin to Ivern or Singed in that she's a champion who's mastery is unique to herself and will not help you improve at anything besides playing Yuumi. Champions like these always reward basically one tricking them and end up with low play rates because of it, even if they're mechanically simple and powerful (see Ivern). So balancing Yuumi around being an all-inclusive enchanter for beginners is a horrible idea, and the data backs it up, beginners cannot play Yuumi. Low elo players cannot play Yuumi. But she's so nerfed that Yuumi mains and pros also cannot play Yuumi, so what's left? Who is this champion for?

The rework simultaneously removed her counterplay and removed her power, so she's less satisfying for both sides, and less healthy for the game as a whole. What is she even supposed to do anymore? Her healing and shielding is bad. She offers little to no crowd control. Her damage is bad. Her unique remaining niche is basically just being able to support dive carries like Zeri or Twitch, who can get into weird positions with a Yuumi where other supports would struggle to follow and help them, but is that really all an entire champion should offer? She can't even do that with non-adcs anymore because of the dumb best friend mechanic, and the changes to her kit to where she now empowers specifically auto attacks instead of giving stats, and that empowerment scales with your ally's crit, trying so hard to make sure you cannot get creative with who she's paired with. Because of that, even slightly non traditional adcs like Lethality Varus can't benefit from these buffs.

They need to revert this rework and balance Yuumi with the intention of her being a low playrate niche champion with a high skill floor, it's the only way she can remain functional. It's not what they wanted her to be, but clearly she's failed at what they wanted her to be, so what else can they do?",3398,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17wqfq7/can_we_call_yuumis_rework_a_complete_failure_yet/,1700150579.0,0.9922

Everyone, including the balance team should accept that Zeri cannot exist in her current form. Ultramobile ADC, can build AD and AP and still one shot ppl from a Lux R range every 7 sec. Meanwhile her chase and kite potential is nearly limitless.

I personally dont have an issue with either, but they share the item pool of an entire class of champions, and when this class is strong, these 2 get really obnoxious and when ADC are weak, these 2 become useless.

Yasuo and Yone have many build paths that make sense on paper like BORK rush or Triforce (which Yasuo has used in the past) but that cant be utilized because of their passives. They need 2 crit items to fully utilize their passives. Even if you dont always see crit rush right now, at some point you need it.

I think there is room to remove crit dependance from both Yasuo and Yone, and shift their power to more AD, Attack Speed and HP and Haste. That way it opens up the item market for them, and ADC champions wont have their items gutted or nerfed because of 2 melee champions sharing an item pool with them.

I've always enjoyed the crit mechanic on these 2 champions, and I have played them a lot, but if its something that I want to give up to be better balanced around items, its this passive. I think its a win win for everyone in the long run.

There are items that exist that these champions cant even begin to use with their current scaling. Black Cleaver, Spear, the entire lethality pool of items, etc..",2315,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1d7uqdr/i_think_yasuoyone_are_champions_that_would/,1717500228.0,0.9944
Reddit,General Balance Feedback,game balance,leagueoflegends,"One of the worst balance decisions in the last several years was mitigating the respective weakness of early, mid, and late game champions","One of the worst balance decisions in the last several years was mitigating the respective weakness of early, mid, and late game champions A large part of this game's balance is dependent upon having an early game, mid game, and late game where different champs with different strengths and weaknesses all have equal time to shine at different points in the game. Early game champs (Lee Sin, Elise, etc.) exchange extremely poor scaling for the best chance to be able to close a game out early. Late game champs (A-Sol, Kayle, Twitch, etc.) give up the early and mid game to have crazy power in the late game. Mid game champs (Garen, Darius, etc.) are somewhere in between by spiking mid game without a particularly good early or late game. 

All this has essentially gone out the window in recent years, and the primary reason is Riot deciding that it would be better if late game champs spiked at 2 items instead of 3. Now early game champs have significantly less time to close out games because late game champs only need to stall until maybe 25 min at the most, and that's only if they're really getting hammered. The mid game is now essentially non-existent since games are ending before 30 min on average in many elos. 

I personally find it extremely frustrating when the clearly better team loses simply because they weren't able to close out the game in 20 minutes. The balance direction that Riot seems to be leaning towards feels very unga bunga flashy flashy damage first brain never and I'm just not here for it.

Reddit,General Balance Feedback,game balance,leagueoflegends,Crit has been balanced around smooth scaling into 100% crit 6-item builds. Games last for 26 mins on average.,"Crit has been balanced around smooth scaling into 100% crit 6-item builds. Games last for 26 mins on average. Welcome to the new episode of The Great Crit Circlejerk of 2020.

Crit is now balanced around slowly stacking up 20% crit items into an IE finisher for the ultimate smooth curve of damage. It's a beautiful concept on paper, but it's pure fantasy when **games end in 26 minutes on average** and are for sure decided earlier than that, at 1-2 items.

This is specially so in high elo, where comebacks are rarer and ADSupports (Ashe, Jhin, Senna) have been the norm botlane because they aren't deadweight at 1-2 items. This makes 6-item builds a non-factor when balancing anything. Just think, in what % of your SoloQ games do you get to 6 items? And this has only got worse in preseason since crit builds are more expensive.

The real crit dmg we see in 90% of the gameplay that matters is 175%, paired with 20-40% crit chance. **Maxed IE crit dmg (215%) and 100% crit are pointless, fantasy-land stats.**

So there's been a big mismatch between Riot's new crit philosophy and the reality of SoloQ games. You all have come up with countless solutions to crit, but imo, the most realistic one is to make crit builds **cheaper**: it's simple for Riot, and we keep their smooth crit-stacking philosphy, **but it happens faster**, fast enough to compete with the other roles.",5487,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/jzk75q/crit_has_been_balanced_around_smooth_scaling_into/,1606147052.0,0.128

Reddit,General Balance Feedback,game balance,leagueoflegends,Soraka new R is the proof that game can't be balanced just by tuning stats,"Soraka new R is the proof that game can't be balanced just by tuning stats I saw a recent post about the soraka change, people started to question what they are supposed to do to counter soraka sice now her R removes gw, but i think that it's the wrong interpretation.

if an adc build gw or someone uses ignite gw is applied all the time so this doesn't change how gw works, it's not that her R counter gw.

""soraka now heal X ammount when she press R period. not a X+-60%"" this is the only difference, which makes sense, it's not that she counter antihealing items.

it's just that riot finally admitted that if an item removes 60% of something the game becomes just impossible to balance.

to cite another player: Soraka needs her ult to have gw cleansing because otherwise her numbers on her ult cannot be buffed high enough or it varies too much with gw.

what they are supposed to do? put insanely high numbers on her R knowing they will reduced by 60%? fine but now if you don't build gw you autolose the game.

keep her healing low? fine but now you autowin the game if you build antihealing that cut by 60% healing.

this fixes soraka but it doesn't fix the core issue: an item that change by 60% something is just a bad design, to make things more clear suppose that instead of healing it cut 60% of the damage, it would be broken op right? so what do we do? we buff every champ damage knowing that it will reduced? or we keep low damage?

both answers are plain wrong, if you buff the damage and you don't buy the item you auto lose, if you keep damage low and you build the item you autowin, so both teams are forced to buy that item.

i think they should remove lifesteal at all, if you want healing there is an enchanter support class for that, seeing that there is an item that can do soraka job is bad.  

or at least lower lifesteal globally so that gw items can remove less than 60% of healing.",2775,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/pfvudr/soraka_new_r_is_the_proof_that_game_cant_be/,1630508957.0,-0.9958

Reddit,General Balance Feedback,game balance,leagueoflegends,The reason this game is becoming less balanced is because everyone wants to be a carry...,"The reason this game is becoming less balanced is because everyone wants to be a carry... ...and Riot is pandering to it.

In the past the game functioned in a way which supported 2/3 dedicated carries on a team.

This was most commonly mid and ADC (plus or minus top lane). This made sense from a design stand point. You had a relatively safe solo lane in mid which provided gold and levels required to scale. You then had a duo lane bot with a support dedicated to helping an ADC get as much gold as possible, their main requirement to become strong. Then as I said, you had top lane. This was either a tank (which actually functioned as a tank, we'll return to this...) or a bruiser/carry which again took advantage of solo experience and gold.

Supports and junglers were relatively low economy and this lent itself to running utility based champions in those roles, who did not require huge amounts of gold/XP to function.

This was actually a really good state of affairs - you had different roles genuinely trying to fulfil different objectives to support their team in different ways.

This wasn't enough for people. EVERYONE should get to do MORE DAMAGE and have MORE GOLD and get MORE KILLS and CARRY HARDER.

Over the years, Riot have pretty drastically increased the amount of gold available to junglers and supports. They've also increased the XP available to junglers. This was required to an extent (the era of junglers being Alistar and only buying Oracles and clearing wards was the other end of the spectrum and equally bad) but it's gone way too far.

What this leads to is what people thought they wanted - every role to be a 'carry' role.

Supports get way more gold, and so the role allows champions like Zyra and Malzahar to function down their as secondary AP carries. They aren't mage supports, they are AP carries - they quite often top the damage charts. This might be 'fun' for the support player, but it's honestly just straight up bad for the game.

Junglers are champions like Kha'zix, Rengar and Graves not because these champions suddenly got massively better, but because the jungle now offers them comparable resources (gold and XP) to solo lanes without them having to do anything special to get it. Farming the jungle SHOULD NOT provide the level of resources farming a solo lane does, because it is just fundamentally 'easier' and safer. Previously these champions were risky, because they needed successful ganks to get the resources they needed to be useful. Now they don't.

Top lane became a problem due to the same underlying reason but in a different way. It wasn't enough for top lane carries to exist, people wanted to be able to KILL PEOPLE no matter what type of top laner they picked. Therefore you get damage creep on tanks because everyone should do DAMAGE right?

A tank's function *should* be to soak up damage and provide CC. It *should* be to lock up enemy carries, prevent them doing damage to meaningful targets and allow their own carries to output their own damage.

What it *shouldn't* be is to be fucking invincible whilst also doing a *lot* of damage. No, an ADC with 2 damage items shouldn't be able to melt a tank with 2 armour items in no time at all. But the tank also shouldn't have enough damage to just straight up shit on the ADC 1vs1. Frankly it should be a bit of a wet noodle fight in a 1 on 1 situation.

In my opinion, tanks which function in a healthy way in this game are champions like Leona and Braum. They provide consistent CC, support their carries and interact in a way which enables their team. Poppy, Maokai and Nautilus simply don't. They are one man fucking armies who do way too much damage for how tanky they are. Either take away a lot of their damage and actually make them tanks (honestly I don't care if this means they don't function well in top lane - opening up top lane to bruisers and shifting tanks elsewhere is perfectly fine in my opinion) or take away some of their tankiness and make them bruisers.

The reason AD carries feel so week at the moment is because of the above, not because they 'do no damage' or just suck compared to previous seasons. 

Take a champion like Vayne as an example. Vayne still does a tonne of damage, that isn't her problem. In previous seasons, Vayne had to worry about the damage from probably 2 or 3 sources on the enemy team when getting in range to auto. Now, she can literally get blown up by pretty much anyone. In a standard game - without being massively fed - a support Zyra, a jungle Kha'Zix and even a fucking top lane tank Poppy will absolutely blow up a Vayne if they catch her. That's why she can't function, because supports, junglers and tanks get so many more resources and do so much more damage that standard AD carries simply can't get in range to fight when one miss-step results in them getting fucked by pretty much anyone on the enemy team.

ADC feels so weak because now everyone else gets so many more resources that they've been crowded out of their primary function (doing damage).

Doing damage might feel cool and fun, but honestly everyone doing a tonne of it just isn't good for the game. Giving everyone enough resources to be a 'carry' might feel fun for the Zyra who gets to oneshot the ADC and do the most damage in game, but it isn't good for the game. It just ends up feeling unfulfilling for everyone.

Things need taking back a step. Junglers and supports need to lose some resources so that lower econ champions function better there again (and high damage carries are actually a risk) and tanks need to lose some damage.

Let's go back to a time when:

* Top lane brought actual tanks or bruisers to the party
* Junglers supported and enabled their lanes/team
* Mid laners provided the (generally burst) damage/high impact utility
* AD carries brought the consistent damage and killed the tanks nobody else could burn through
* Supports...well supports were actually supports with CC, utility, healing and abilities which enabled their carries

That shit^ was a million times better than everyone being a carry and oneshotting each other.

Or that's my 2 cents, anyway.

Edit: a LOT of replied are misunderstanding me to mean that only mid/ADC should be impactful or should be more impactful than other roles. Perhaps this is a result of my choice of title, but what I was actually trying to get at was that damage isn't and shouldn't be the only way to 'carry'. 

People have pushed for all the roles to be high damage because they feel like that's more fun and makes them more impactful.

What I'm saying is it was better (IMO) when the so-called 'carry' roles were primarily defined by damage output, whilst other roles could have just as big an impact but in different ways.

ADCs feel like they've lost their place because their major role has always been damage output. When every role has huge damage output, they feel like they don't bring anything special.

I feel it was better when other roles more commonly had their impact in different ways, rather than every role just being about doing as much damage as possible.

EDIT2: Also since I'm getting the ""Hurr durr moaning ADC main"" thing a lot, I am not and have never been an ADC carry player. This meta also suits the champions I play. That doesn't make it good.",3077,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5vpr33/the_reason_this_game_is_becoming_less_balanced_is/,1487846665.0,0.2805

Literally wait 15-20 minutes before being relevant in 95% of games. Queue 6 games? 2 hours of not being relevant with maybe 5-10 minutes of fun action every game, if the other team is not massively ahead already. Thats 2 hours of non-fun for 30 minutes of potential fun. The only 'fun' part if the klepto procs you get, but then you remember that you need those to stay even in gold, not get ahead.

15-20 minutes of being camped 2vs1, farming under tower, trying to cs. My jungler comes, cant do much but 1 Q 1 E if jungler has no hard cc - very low kill pressure. Jungler knows this and never come top, enemy jungler camps top.

Can't really teleport bot lane for the same reason pre 11 - after which there's no botlane anymore most of the time.

Can't trade in lane against most meta top lane champs, which get to be relevant all game.

When you do become relevant at lvl 14-16, IF the match is still kinda even overall, its really fun! But it happens maybe 1 game out of 5? 2 games out of 5 game is lost before then, the other 2 are won by either mid or bot before then and you get to join them, throw a few heals, and nexus explodes. So your potential 30-60 minutes of fun is really down to less than 15 per 3 hour period.

Also the meme of Kayle is a god post-16 hurts more than it helps - she is very strong, but can get cc'd / focused just fine - if you ult yourself, you don't deal much damage because you have to reposition, or you end up in the midst of their team.

I really love the visual rework (even got used to Aether wing being weird), most of the kit rework is an improvement compared to before if you compare individual skills. But I'd gladly drop the stupid true damage post 16 I never get to see / use 95% of the time to be more relevant early game - the evolving kit shouldn't mean going from dreadful to strong at 40 minutes, the curve right now is stupid steep.

Most kayle streamers I follow (Kayle1vs9 and Unsung) either vocally say the champ is unfun while playing it, or stopped maining it altogether because it's unfun (and straight up said so). Odds are since the rework just happened that Kayle will stay like this for a long time / forever... I don't have high hopes that Riot wants to fix this anytime soon.

With old Kayle at least you could agressively trade against most champs. At worst, you could agressively splitpush / duel - can't do that anymore with the reworked ult, the 1vs1 DPS is not anywhere near high enough.",2349,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/bu6695/i_stopped_playing_kayle_because_the_rework_is/,1559080750.0,-0.5795

\- "" We’ve started work on a larger scale Yuumi rework to help this cat land in a much healthier spot. We want to highlight what Yuumi as an attached, untargetable enchanter can provide to her team.""

This EXACT design is the reason this champ is so despised. The fact that she's un ""untargetable, attached enchanter"" is the exact reason everyone hates her. Those 2 things CANNOT go together, you cannot have a champion who can afk attached on a carry champ, be an enchanter who heals, shields, buffs and peels for that champion, all while being perma untargetable. That cannot and will not ever work.

There's a reason why anytime a poll comes around on ""What champ should be removed?"" Over 70% of the answers are always Yuumi, because of THIS. Having an ""attached, untargetable enchanter"" is not a ""healthier spot"" for the champ to be in, it is the exact opposite. She needs to be forced off of people, made a duration based champion, getting buffs for swapping between multiple people at once, her abilities should do less and less the more she stays on one champion, etc etc. These types of changes are the ones that need to be taking place, not going further and further into that design. This isn't a design where if shes pushed harder and harder that eventually with enough force it will just work. It will just end up being even more toxic and unfun than it is now.

There's a reason nobody at any level of play likes this champ's current design other than Yuumi mains. There's a reason she has been in the top 4 champs of banrate for the last 2 seasons. It's the current design of her champion being an ""attached, untargetable enchanter""

Edit: Also, let me just remind everyone. A player name Saskio played ADC and Yuumi AT THE SAME EXACT TIME using foot pedals and shit and got both accounts to PLATINUM. He was able to play ADC and SUPPORT at the same exact time because he would just put yuumi on the adc, and then just play adc while using footpedals for her heal and shit.

What is the actual idea of lethality supposed to be now? From the http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/preseason-2017/assassins article where they introduced lethality for the first time, 
> Flat armor penetration's been changed to Lethality. They're pretty much the same thing, but the bulk of Lethality's penetration scales with your opponent's level. **This makes it less snowbally**, meaning we can give Assassins more of it than we could flat armor penetration!

Also from the same patch notes,

> Assassins have a snowball problem. When ahead, they’re really ahead, but when behind, they’re pretty underwhelming. In part, this is the nature of a 1-on-1, outplay champion. But for physical assassins, **flat armor penetration is exacerbating the problem.** Mages and marksmen—the assassin’s natural prey—don’t typically build defenses early on, so the bulk of their armor in lane comes from levels (Zhonya’s Hourglass is the main exception). **So, if assassins start snowballing, flat armor penetration punches through a significant portion of their target’s armor, continuing the snowball.** But if assassins fall behind, their threat is mitigated by their targets’ innate stats alone. To give attack damage based assassins more consistency, we’re reworking armor penetration to be more consistently impactful late game without being overbearing early on.


But from the latest 7.14 patch notes here http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-714-notes, 

> But, with mobility removed, the Dirk items need a different way to help assassins carry advantages forward. Changing lethality from enemy-scaling to self-scaling fills this gap while advancing our original goals by pushing it further away from bot-laners (who tend to be lower level).

> SCALING Lethality grants armor penetration based on ~~your target’s level~~ ⇒ your level

I thought the point of lethality was to prevent snowball and to allow bot laners to stand a chance against high level AD assassins. Lethality was to prevent armor pen stacking to shred ADC's low armor before they have a chance to buy into armor items/level up. I know Guardian Angel is now a much more convenient item for ADCs to purchase now but that wasn't the case when the idea of lethality was introduced. Now a solo lane Riven/Zed/Talon or a jungler like Kha'zix or Rengar can power farm through to a high level while stacking lethality and get a 3-5 level advantage of armor pen amongst previous other stats, which sounds pretty broken to me. What is the actual idea of lethality now? Has it's identity changed? Has Riot's stance on snowballing through armor pen changed? Is lethality and AD assassins being weak a reason to change the concept of lethality to what it was supposed to prevent?

Reddit,Patch-Specific Feedback,recent patch,leagueoflegends,People are literally getting psyop'd into thinking the upgraded boots matter,"People are literally getting psyop'd into thinking the upgraded boots matter Every game you see the enemy team get Feats of Strength, if they buy the boot upgrades, they're throwing the tiny lead Feats of Strength gave away, in terms of stats. 

Let me explain.

Let's say you got Sorc Shoes. You now have 2 mpen for free. Cool, that's a nice little buff. But if you spend 750 gp to upgrade them? You've now gotten way less damage than a Blasting Wand; not like 12%ish like the 750 vs 850 gp price would indicate, but about half as much. Yes, it's that bad.

In fact, it's so bad that all the stats together, including the MS, are close to strictly worse than an Aether Wisp until probably around the 20 minute mark. In fact, pre-hotfix, even with the free stats, the total damage increase is about the same as an amp tome at level 8.

This means that upgrading is SO weak that even with the free buff, even pre-hotfix, anyone who purchased upgraded boots after their next item was actually losing power. And if you consider post hotfix stats, and only include the actual benefits of the upgrade (not the free stats), it's a terrible idea to upgrade your boots any time before level 18.

Let me reiterate that. Most of the time your enemies got Feats of Strength and then upgraded their boots, they didn't get stronger. **They were being baited into weakening their build.**

...

Okay, now I realize lots of people have said something very similar. The difference here is I did a truly ridiculous, and frankly unnecessary amount of math to back it up.

# Math

First, I took a few AP champs (Ahri, Anivia, Annie, Azir, Cassiopeia, Karthus, Leblanc, Lux, Orianna, Syndra, Veigar, Viktor, Xerath, Ziggs) and calculated their 5 second damage window, AP scaling/base. I assumed DoT zones (Viktor R, Cass W) dealt damage for 1 second, as opposed to Cass Q which just lasts the 3 seconds (or until the end of the 5 second window). I started at level 8 because it meant I didn't have to deal with ratios jumping at level 6, could still see the effect of your maxed spell going from rank 4 to 5, and you generally won't get Feats much before then.

This gave me 798.03 average base damage and 4.38 (419%) AP scaling. If this sounds kinda high, it's because it's not a single-rotation combo; I chose 5 seconds as a happy medium between burst, poke with missed skillshots, two rotation all-ins, etc. You could argue the details, but needing roughly 200 AP to double your base damage at level 8 is a basic truth that you can see for yourself.

To produce a fair comparison to the 750 gp boot upgrade, I needed a 750 gp item, which doesn't exist. So instead, I averaged 38% of an Aether Wisp, 35% of a Blasting Wand, and 27% of an Amplifying Tome. This hypothetical item would cost 747.5 gp and give 32.55 AP and 1.52% MS, which is, on a 330 MS champ, 5.016 MS. I also gave you AP = (level+3)\^2, which seems relatively realistic; that's 121 AP at level 8 (about 1 item and change), 441 at level 18.

(See **Considerations and Caveats** below, but using realistic items makes it so the boots aren't worth it even at level 18 and 230 MR on the target.)

I then wrote a damage calculation script; it generates tables of 32.55 AP's damage increase vs +7 flat pen and +10 percentage pen. For example:

    Level: 8
    Base Damage: 798
    AP Ratio: 4.19
    Current AP: 121
    Current Flat Pen: 12
    
    resist          +32.5 AP Increase       +7 Flat + 10% Pen Increase
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    37.51           10.43%                  7.59%
    43.84           10.43%                  7.75%
    77.51           10.43%                  8.42%
    83.84           10.43%                  8.51%
    117.51          10.43%                  8.93%
    123.84          10.43%                  9.00%
    157.51          10.43%                  9.28%
    163.84          10.43%                  9.33%

It takes until level 12-13 for a base resist enemy to take more damage from buying boot upgrade over 32.55 AP (level 12 and 49.99 MR, the amount for most melee champs, or level 13 and 42.8 MR, the amount for most ranged champs), while it takes until level 11 at +40 MR from items.

If you count post-hotfix, and only count the stats upgrading actually gives you, even at level 17 it looks like:

    Level: 17
    Base Damage: 1026.79
    AP Ratio: 4.84
    Current AP: 400
    Current Flat Pen: 14
    
    resist          +32.5 AP Increase       +4 Flat + 8% Pen Increase
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    50.44           5.31%                   5.08%
    64.23           5.31%                   5.40%
    90.44           5.31%                   5.88%
    104.23          5.31%                   6.08%
    130.44          5.31%                   6.39%
    144.23          5.31%                   6.52%
    170.44          5.31%                   6.74%
    184.23          5.31%                   6.84%

# Considerations and Caveats

There are many things you could change to this methodology, which might make it more or less accurate. Here are a few I thought of, ranked from roughly best for me to worst for me:

* **There are obviously other boots... that are probably weaker.** 
   * Since these are the boots that got by far the most gutted by the hotfix, I think the indicator that they were the strongest is pretty clear. While not having an easy, direct comparison, the others are probably significantly worse. In particular, those don't scale that hard with levels/enemy MR, which means that almost certainly, **all other upgrades are worse than components at ALL levels.**
* **You're not actually going to buy an Aether Wisp and sit on it.** 
   * What you're actually going to do is, on average, be 750 gp further into your build, which is going to give you a full item like 1/4 of the time, and a component the other 3/4 of the time. For example, if you consider that Cosmic Drive has about 135% gold efficiency, while our weird hybrid component has about 103.7%, then we have an average of about 111.5% gold efficiency throughout the build. If we take that extra gold and maintain the +5 MS, we should be getting more like 36.9 AP (or equivalent stats) on average. This means that, even pre-patch, buying the boots before level 16ish was probably a mistake.
* **My numbers aren't realistic, and don't account for actual items.** 
   * This is most definitely true, because AP doesn't scale quadratically with level, it scales in jumps when you complete items, and usually a big part of your power budget is in other bonuses. 
   * However, almost every item for mages functionally has a large part of power budget spent on linear scaling (AP), and then some part spent on a multiplicative scaling (pen, %damage amp, or even things like getting vision off Horizon are force multipliers). 
      * If, for example, we used something like Haunting Guise + Aether Wisp - Ruby Crystal, instead of Aether Wisp + Amp Tome + Blasting Wand, the boots will literally never be better. 
      * It's not quite as elegant as having exactly 38% + 35% + 27% = 100%, but 54% of a Haunting Guise - 72% of a Ruby Crystal + 37% of an Aether Wisp is pretty close. And, fun fact, **this makes the Haunting Guise version more efficient at level 18 + 227 MR.** 
      * (The actual output line is 226.85 MR, +9.00% damage from Guise vs +8.97% from boots.)
   * That said, being off by a little bit on how much AP you have, or how much a typical AP scaling is, could absolutely affect the numbers by a significant amount.
   * However, basically, any ""realistic"" simulation would be super difficult, and most of the corners I cut I cut in favor of the boots; fixing them would probably make the boots look even worse.
* **I did 32.5 instead of 32.55**. Oops.
* **You probably don't even get the boots until level 10-13ish.**
   * Okay, yeah. But someone did the math on when people hit what levels, recently-ish: [https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1bhuxpi/data\_average\_levelup\_timers\_by\_role/](https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1bhuxpi/data_average_levelup_timers_by_role/)
   * According to that, you're probably at just over 19 minutes by the time you hit level 13 even on mid/top, and even this absolute worst case (pre hotfix, with free stats, super conservative estimations) just means the boots are a net neutral when the FF vote comes in. So, I feel pretty confident in saying that, in the vast majority of FFs at minute 20-21 due to Feats of Strength, anyone who bought the boots had lost power due to them, not gained it.
* **None of this matters because it's not the stats that lose, it's the tilted players.**
   * See, I actually agree with this, kind of. It is true that gaining Feats of Strength massively increases your winrate. But if it's literally worse to buy the Sorc Shoes upgrade than an Aether Wisp (then sitting on it), we **know** the boots are a placebo. The solution to that isn't to nerf them even further, it's to stop believing in the placebo.

# TL;DR:

Any mage who bought Spellslinger's Shoes before full build was literally doing worse than *not* winning Feats, buying an Aether Wisp, and never upgrading it. In practice, the fact that the other boots scale worse and didn't get nerfed means that they're all terrible to buy any time before full build.

Basically, I'm very confident the boot thing has been almost entirely irrelevant this whole time; the ""reward"" was and is a trap. Any perceived increase in snowballing, despair, FF votes etc has been other effects, and frankly, I'd bet money that it's mostly psychological.",2435,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1i17clu/people_are_literally_getting_psyopd_into_thinking/,1736865186.0,0.5168

Warwick is clunkier than ever

His hitbox changes were made in 14.9 from 55-65, making him lose his slippery yordle hitbox and now with the recent changes his model size got increased by 15%, but the thing about Warwick is his base stats are trash. Other champions like Illaoi, Olaf and Urgot make sense since their base stats are very high and they are not easy to kill. Warwicks main counterplay to this weakness is his E which has a high dmg reduction but a high cooldown meaning you peel/stay alive for long. So either reverse the changes to what they were or give us better stats.

Warwick Q hasn't even gotten touched despite the fact that it's probably the buggiest ability in the game rn, sometimes acting like a hold when tapping or vice versa, not avoiding knock ups during it's animations, sometimes the ability goes on cd when enemies walk into bushes making you lose mana and deal no dmg thus healing nada.

Warwick W changes have not even been mentioned in the patch notes and it is now showing the wrong information, it mentioned that abilities will now be able to proc the AS from W and the AS lingers for 1 sec which at first would make any ww main go ""Oh, so they make Warwick play smoother"". Nope, what they instead did is they made Warwick W not give any attack speed at all in the first hit, making his farming under turret extremely vulnerable, waveclear feels clunky, and trading shortly with champions has become an actual pain. And his W attack speed and movement speed bonuses have decreased, they no longer triple when targets get below 20%, they now only double when enemies get below 25%. But still holding onto hope we thought we were getting our out of combat ms work in combat to not get cancelled by enemy champions unless we are the ones to hit them, that is how it was in pbe, that is how it is in the tooltip, but no it isn't there.

Warwick E lock out getting halved from 0.5 to 0.25 is a placebo buff, in reality, you can actually cancel the animation of E2 by simply Q'ing and then using E2 right after. But if you decide to try that now you will instead be greeted by one of Warwicks Q bugs that made his Q act like a hold no matter how lightly and fast you will tap the ability, but now that bug skyrocketed increasing the chance of that to happening from about 10-20% to about 80-90% test it in practice tool.

Warwick R changes, this is a mixed bag for me as it is nice to have your ultimate finally not have the width of Yasuo Q anymore (I wish I was joking) 80 vs 100 units of width on Warwick R that is now 150. They also removed the Warwick R hitbox at the back, which is a good change that adds skill expression and makes Warwick good at fleeing instead of hitting the enemies that are touching the tip of your tail. But they went absolutely overboard with it as champions that are right up your a#& or inside of you, will not get hit by the Warwick ultimate unless your cursor is directly on top of them. It also seems that for the few frames of jumping you cannot actually hit stuff making it very easy to miss your ultimate when a champion is directly next to you

But anyway I would simply like to say that these arcane season 2 ""buffs"" need to get reverted, they have made Warwick. A champion that has already felt extremely clunky even clunkier than before.

So I would like to give my opinions on what the Warwick changes should look like

1. I think Warwick should get straight up buffs without any nerfs to his kit, I'm not gonna lie Warwick is extremely weak in the jungle and he is not that strong top lane (unless you abuse barrier in diamond). I think it is kind of disgusting for Warwick to get AD/AP scaling to his passive 4 years ago due to him obviously falling out of meta, and 1 year ago we got buffs to his Q dealing extra damage to monsters, and W getting less cd and more ms, since Warwick jungle was actually pathetic at the time compared to every other jungler that can waveclear 3x times as fast whether it's a single camp like gromp, or the you will need to buy tiamat for this aka raptors.
2. Warwick should receive lots of bugfixes, this one is a no brainer as Warwicks spaghetti code has been breaking in lots of places, in this season Warwicks gotten a bug that makes his W not give him any movement speed against low targets whether it's the passive or the active, and it doesn't give you vision of enemies that have walked into bushes, or are recalling in said bushes, this happens about 5-10% of the time now but it is game changing. Warwick Q is getting more inconsistent with every patch. And Warwick E hitbox is still dragging behind harder than Santas ballsack in july when using Q to follow targets thus making your fear miss while latching onto a target that has used a blink/dash ability.
3. Every champ besides Warwick has received so much love over the years with constant buffs, and mini reworks with minimal if any drawback whatsoever. Like actually go look at champs like Gnar and Kennen that has received like 9 buffs in the past 5 years that were not small by any stretch of the imagination. Fiora, Gragas, Jax, Riven, And recently Irelia have gotten insane buffs to their splitpushing removing any counterplay to them. Bullies like Jayce, Darius, Garen, Renekton, and Urgot have received so many buffs that it is insane. And Warwick has gotten barely any love because we have to think about low elo guys, when champions like Garen and Trundle are 10x worse there. But there is also a fair point when addressing the Warwick top barrier abusers for which I don't think are that problematic when they fall off a cliff after laning phase without teleport, or any good items that actually scale. So I think it's fair to throw the dog a bone every now and then
4. Everyone knows how easy it is to counter Warwick. And People act like he doesn't have any counterplay since they hate Warwick because of 3 things, his early game sustain, his Q latch mechanics that makes everyone mad when they flash and Warwick is still biting their ass, and the barrier abusers on top getting ultra fed early and ending the game because in diamond and below, if you win laning phase you win the game. But I digress, anyway, everyone knows to just buy oblivion orb and Warwick can get easily poked out and die now since everyone one shots the other champ, Warwick W movement speed is out of combat and his base movement speed is 335 meaning if you hit him once he goes 100-0 real quick, usually gets kited, and dies. Warwick R was incredibly easy to dodge since it had a shit hitbox that made every WW main look like a first timer when they miss an ultimate, and what's even funnier, everyone knows how easy it is to cancel Warwick ultimate by yourself with the most basic of abilites, Garen Q, TF stun, Udyr E, Vel'koz E, Hwei fear, Fiddle Q/E, Cho'gath Q/W, Darius E ect. Champions with long windup animations can time their abilities at the last moment to just shrug off Warwick by themselves, which is something riot has actually removed in the past, when every Singed player started using E on Warwick and always flipped them out of their ult, just check the patch notes.

With that being said I will now go over the Warwick buff that I believe our doggo deserves

How to actually fix Warwick (Don't add all of these changes just some of them except for bug fixes)

\- Reduce Warwicks hitbox and size to what it used to be since Warwicks base stats suck, or increase his base stats... a lot

\- Increase Warwicks base ms speed by 5 it made sense 7 years ago when champs didnt have 4 dashes, Movement speed buffs, and incredible base stats

\- Make Q deal AOE dmg against monsters

\- Change W movement speed so when you get hit you will lose about 80% of the current movement speed instead of going from 100-0 also it has a 0-3.5 ramp up

\- Make Warwick E deal damage to monsters so that junglers can actually use this ability against camps (active or passive maybe bami cinder mini passive against monsters)

\- Make Warwick R not get cancelled by the enemy champions basic abilites (everyone knows how to counter this now)

\- Make Warwick R cost less mana from 100 to all ranks to 100-50-0 lvl 6-11-16 (Warwick got left behind with the sheen changes and didn't receive buff to his mana 10.23

I believe Warwick jungle takes priority as his waveclear is ass without tiamat, and even with it is lackluster. Warwick top should receive some smaller buffs maybe AD, MS, Ressistances, or HP.

BUG FIXES

HIGH PRIORITY

\- Fix Warwick Q acting like a hold when tapping and vice versa

\- Fix Warwick Q going on cd, losing mana, not dealing dmg, and not healing when enemy targets walk into bushes

\- Fix Warwick Q sometimes getting cc'd by knockups mid animation

\- Fix Warwick W MS so that it doesn't bug out and not give you any movement speed on both passive and activ

\- Fix Warwick E hitbox when Q'ing through targets so it actually hits people around instead of following your model with a delay thus making the fear not hit at all

\- Fix Warwick R so you don't just stand there for 1.5 seconds when a champion uses an orange, Olaf ult, or Qss,(RELEASE ME)

\- Fix Warwick R so that it cannot get cancelled by basic abilites like Garen Q, Darius, E, Fiddle Q/E ect. But it can get cancelled by ultimate abilities like Gragas R, Qyiana R, Malphite R etc ( no idea how they would impliment this but it would be the most fair thing to do IMO) EDIT! I meant basic abilities from the target you are currently ulting not every basic ability, teammates like Rell, and Leona would still be able to cc you out of the target Ww is ulting. That would be really stupid as it would remove counterplay and I'm sorry for causing confusion in the comment threads.

MID PRIORITY

\- Fix Warwick Q healing after you are dead (maybe make it's damage animation speed based on attack speed)

\- Fix Warwick W attack speed for real this time, no need to use tiamat after getting a target low to receive the bonus upon getting enemies below 50% and 20% right after, or pressing S and then clicking on it again, or clicking on ground and then on target

\- Warwick E hitbox being really bad at fearing people behind Warwick (I'm not insane everyone else is)

Anyways this is a lot longer than I thought it would be. Thank you for actually paying attention to the ramblings of a madman, it means a lot. I just feel so disappointed with these changes and wanted to get them off my chest while also adding my reasoning, and thoughts on what Warwick actually needs.

I hope you all have a good day.

Edit: it seems that Warwick is broken in more ways than I even thought, looking at the Warwick main subreddit which is rn overflowing with bugs from the new changes, and every Ww main/player hating these changes (roughly 90% of them) agree that Ww feels more clunky, buggy, and less satisfying overall. With every non ww player/main barely reading this post and typing stuff like ""Finally Warwick is balanced"" and stuff like that. Anyways I would like to thank all of you, even the not so supportive part of community for bringing awareness to this issue.

2nd Edit: the changes have been now live for a while now and it has done exactly what I've feared it would do, Make Warwick a crazy good right clicking stat checker in low elo both in jgl and top (with barrier abusers taking most of the credit), that falls off mid-late game. And absolutely useless in higher levels of play. Warwick has now cemented his fate to always be a right clicking. Barrier Relying. Clunky. Buggy. Stat checker. (unless these changes get reverted)",2230,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1glm6fj/warwick_changes_were_a_mistake_1422/,1730969603.0,0.9575
Reddit,Patch-Specific Feedback,recent patch,leagueoflegends,"In 2 months after Crit Item rework, every class that previously used it is turning away from it.","In 2 months after Crit Item rework, every class that previously used it is turning away from it. This post is not about ADC's because I actually think they are in a good spot once they reach the time in game where they ""should"" be relevant.

Its about crit items feeling bad to purchase and in general being very underwhelming, and it goes beyond the ADC role. Its in top, jgl and mid as well.

A lot of champions, that used to rush crit are now opting out of it willingly, and they deal less damage, but they feel better to play.

###MID
The most obvious examples are Yone and Yasuo over the recent year going into Bork > Stridebreaker for more survivability instead of raw damage.

###TOP
Tryndamere used to rush Crit items, but is now another general Grasp abuser who plays the sustain game with Ravenous Hydra. He rushes Navori second, but not for the crit, but the passive instead for more E spins which is really good. Quinn has also dropped crit for Lethality and only purchase crit to round out the build.

###JGL
Graves is leaning more into Lethality in the jungle and Rengar and Master Yi are not incentivized to build crit items, due to ability limitations. Mainly Rengars Q modifier and Master Yi's Q scaling which was buffed this patch, but has not shifted Yi's playstyle away from Bork > Rageblade. Shaco is building hybrid AP and Crit later. Kindred rushes Trinity Force.

Regardless of class and role, everyone that is able to shy away from Crit is doing it. And there is plenty of reason for it.

IE is generally needed to round off a crit build and its garbage. 3600g for no item spike is pure madness. Shieldbow not having lifesteal feels really bad. Bloodthirster not having crit feels really bad. LDR not having ""Giant Slayer"" feels really bad.

The fact that Kraken Slayer, Statik Shiv are not crit items anymore also feels really bad.

I used to go Shieldbow IE on Yauso Yone and that was fun. Kraken > Navori on Tryndamere and Tristana and Xayah was really fun. 

Crit items are either underwhelming, or too expensive or both and if you have a champion capable of leaning into Lethality for the first 1-2 items, you are better off doing so.

At no stage in League did I think Jinx would be leaning into Lethality instead of Crit. But we had that a few patches ago. Even now, the build that is taking over Korean SoloQ is Jinx buying Huilbreaker 2nd/3rd item.

Crit needs a massive overhaul, not just for the ADC's but a lot of other champions as well that feel bad currently because the items are not worth it.",2128,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1hgcn16/in_2_months_after_crit_item_rework_every_class/,1734448094.0,-0.2175

**Direct Purchase Currency Comparison From Pass Rewards**

To use a point of comparison, Limbus Company, one of the more F2P friendly gacha games that also relies almost exclusively on a Battle Pass based progression system. It has also been running for multiple years and is consistently in the middle range of gacha revenue, so this is not a small title or an IP cashgrab.

A character in Limbus Company requires 400 Shards, you get 2 per shard box on average (1-3, equal weight), and can freely assign these shards. The Free To Play battle pass gives 380 Shard boxes that can be freely assigned, alongside 75 randomly assigned boxes. This totals to 1.9 characters at the highest price point.

[https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/Dispenser](https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/Dispenser) Link to page with cost per item and purchasable item list. [https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/Egoshard](https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/Egoshard) Link to page explaining shards and crates. [https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/Season\_5:\_Oblivion#:\~:text=Extraction-,Season%27s%20Pass%20Rewards,-Collapse](https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/Season_5:_Oblivion#:~:text=Extraction-,Season%27s%20Pass%20Rewards,-Collapse) Link to full list of Battle Pass rewards.

League of Legends battle pass gives 4750 Blue Essence, with 6300 required to purchase a new champion and 7800 used to purchase the most recently released. This is slightly over 0.75 of a highest price point new character that is not currently on the front page splash art. Note that this will be increased in future passes, but that is over a month away and subject to change.

[https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/List\_of\_champions](https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/List_of_champions) Link to official wiki page on champions that can be sorted by pricepoint. For the purpose of this claim, 6300 Champions were used. Claim still holds true for 4800 champions at this time, but may not hold true next battle pass.

Limbus Battle Pass gives 3 additional EGO unlocks. I don't want to get into the weeds of gacha game mechanics, so we will just be treating this as equal to characters. In game these are priced the same as characters, but are more valuable. These do not require additional money-linked currency to improve in any way, but do need to be levelled up because RPG gonna RPG.

League of Legends gives 4 character capsules that give a random character and require Blue Essence to upgrade or can have their contents sold for Blue Essence.

[https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/V25.S1.1#:\~:text=And%20others.-,Battle%20Pass,-A%20Season%20is](https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/V25.S1.1#:~:text=And%20others.-,Battle%20Pass,-A%20Season%20is) Link to Battle Pass Rewards for League Of Legends. I could not find a precise value of everything in the current pass on the wiki itself, but it's available ingame if you want to count it up. Note that Riot has since changed BE value from post-completion rewards from 50 to 750.

\--------------------------

**Rate of Battle Pass Rewards**

Without quests, Limbus Company gives 3 Battle Pass Levels per run of its primary repeatable mode. This takes between 15 and 20 minutes to complete, and the pass has 120 levels. Weekly quests add another 31 levels over 3 runs or one hour real time. In a single week's play, it would take, with no other quests, 10 hours of play to full clear the pass. Additional quests are granted daily and weekly, and would remove approximately 4 runs, for 8 hours and 40 minutes.

[https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/Mirror\_of\_the\_Dreaming#:\~:text=Weekly%20Bonus%0ACharges%20Used](https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/Mirror_of_the_Dreaming#:~:text=Weekly%20Bonus%0ACharges%20Used) Link to citation of income.

A League of Legends game takes between 20 to 40 minutes on average, with most games landing in the 20-30 minute range. Rate of pass rewards is heavily obfuscated due to a quest centric system, with the base earnings rate being around 50 BEXP per game. For the sake of factoring in quests, I will increase this to an average of 100 per game. This could be higher or lower. It takes 500 Battle Pass EXP to gain one level, making for an average of 5 games, and a 50 level pass.

[https://lolvalue.com/blog/how-long-are-lol-games-duration#:\~:text=Average%20Time%20for%20a%20LoL%20Match%20Across%20Different%20Ranks](https://lolvalue.com/blog/how-long-are-lol-games-duration#:~:text=Average%20Time%20for%20a%20LoL%20Match%20Across%20Different%20Ranks) Citation for average match length. Note that I cannot verify this. If people have an official Riot or Riot-approved source, it would be appreciated.

With the assumption of 25 minute games, it takes approximately 104 hours and 10 minutes. However, this assumes all quests are available, and attempting to single week grind is functionally impossible.

\-------------------------------

**Post Pass Rewards**

Limbus Company offers 1 manually assigned Shard Box per pass level. This is 0.5% of a character, or 1.5% of a character per individual run. Additional quest rewards exist, but only offer 0.2 of a level per day from this, being functionally irrelevant. Weeklies add an additional 16.5% of a character when factoring for both weekly bonus and quests.

[https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/Season\_5:\_Oblivion#:\~:text=Extraction-,Season%27s%20Pass%20Rewards,-Collapse](https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/Season_5:_Oblivion#:~:text=Extraction-,Season%27s%20Pass%20Rewards,-Collapse) Bottom of rewards list lists post-pass rewards.

League of Legends offers 750 Blue essence for 4 of the 5 levels, for an average of 600 Blue Essence per level. This is 10.5% of a character, and requires 5 games per level assuming a standard average rate of 100 BEXP per game. Or 2.1% of a character per game. However, most quest rewards are frontloaded, likely resulting in this value being higher than actual experience earnings and thus lower practical value. Due to obfuscation, this is hard to calculate, but tentative assessment is at sub 1%.

\---------------------------------

**Gacha Currency**

Limbus Company offers 1050 Gacha currency per week, or 8 rolls, untethered from the Battle Pass, as well as a fixed 650, or 5 rolls, and 12 direct rolls, for 8 rolls per week + 17 flat rolls from the battle pass. The statistical odds of one of these rolls acquiring the item the player is rolling for is 1.45%, with failed rolls being worth 1.5 Shard Boxes, assigned randomly in the worst case scenario, or 5 or 25 Shard Boxes assigned randomly for higher rarity items that are already owned by the player. The player only needs to acquire any given item once, with no bonus for duplicates.

[https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/Lunacy#:\~:text=Mail%20sent%20to%20the%20player%20after%20game%20maintenance%20will%20typically%20contain%20a%20reward%20of%20300%20Lunacy](https://limbuscompany.wiki.gg/wiki/Lunacy#:~:text=Mail%20sent%20to%20the%20player%20after%20game%20maintenance%20will%20typically%20contain%20a%20reward%20of%20300%20Lunacy) Citation of weekly maint reward of 300. 750 is shown in Mirror Dungeon rewards. Page also shows costs per pull.

Shards acquired by failed rolls may be used to acquire the featured item. Shards acquired by other means may also be freely used to acquire the featured item after one week, or any non-featured item at any time, subject to very few restrictions.

(Not giving citation due to above links proving statement)

League of Legends does not offer players free gacha currency. At all. The mathematical odds of hitting the target item is 0.5%. There is no non-gacha way to acquire the featured item, and failed rolls do not help. At this time, there is no way to acquire a featured gacha item that is not currently available to be rolled on.

A single roll in Limbus Company costs \~$1.75 USD. A single roll in League of Legends is \~$3.75 USD.

\-----------------------------------------

In summary, congrats League Players, it's officially less exploitative to just play gacha. The current rare of earning new characters via \*direct purchase\* in at least one major global gacha game is now more rapid than it is in League of Legends. Woe betide any new player coming into League, because League has more characters than most gacha games too.

If I made any errors, feel free to point them out. If someone has a better calculation of the rate of BEXP for League, I'd love to hear it. Additionally, Mods, if I have failed to offer sufficient citation on any claims, please notify me. I will be more than happy to edit in any further evidence required on any point. This was all I could think of.

A few caveats to consider however. Mirror Dungeons get faster in Limbus with a more invested account, and League of Legends games get faster on average at higher ELO, resulting in average times being slower in both with newer or less skilled players. They are also still different games, and you can just be a Garen main with 50000 Garen games and be fine if that's your thing.",2352,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1ih3umg/fun_fact_the_current_rate_at_which_players_unlock/,1738626423.0,0.995

A *diversity* of 'OP'-type abilities would be very cool and balance Summoner's Rift out. Right now all the 'OP' characters are kind of same-y in the way that they are OP. But imagine if, for instance, we had characters that had OP [terrain-interaction](https://youtu.be/wDlkFo6Kus0?t=279) abilities, or things like that. The game would start to feel less frustrating to play, because everyone would have access to a form of OP that appeals to them.

The reason I don't play the OP champions (currently the hypermobility dudes) is because that style of play doesn't appeal to me. As someone who mained Teemo for years, I wish there were playstyles that allowed more OP forms of map control and traps and things like that, but e.g. with Teemo, Riot just overtly says that they wouldn't consider it healthy for his shrooms to be strong enough. So they only allow hypermobile players like YONE to be super strong because they want THAT type of gameplay to be the most all-powerful. If they made a new character that *counters* the OP dashes in a creative and equally OP manner, the game would start to actually become more interesting IMO.",843,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1g9vsif/we_need_new_champion_kits_that_are_op_but_op_in_a/,1729638338.0,0.9934

I used to hate aatrox, played him a few times and figured out how to play against him, he has skill shots that need to be landed to be OP.

I hated Garen, played him a few times and still hate him because being less than full hp means he can flash Q, E, Ignite and R you for a nice death for just being in his flash range. Valid reason to still hate the champion.

I used to hate ranged top, then I played literally anything that kills them, Irelia, Graves, jax. Ranged top is the free-est lane in the world for me now.

Reddit,Champion-Specific Issues,champion op,leagueoflegends,Describe any champion to make them sound super OP,"Describe any champion to make them sound super OP Azir is 100% the most broken champ in the game.

He is one of the biggest lane bullies and he scales incredibly well. (pick one riot)

His soldiers give him a max attack range of 1035!! 1035 AUTO ATTACK RANGE??? Caitlyn's is only 650.

But it gets even better, his soldier auto attacks are AOE in a line for 100% damage at level 16 and he gets to build Rylai's Crystal Scepter, meanwhile Frozen Mallet was too unhealthy for 550 range ad champs and had to be removed, but Azir gets the ability to slow on his 1035 range AOE auto attacks.

But of course range doesn't mean much if you get on top of him right? too bad he has 2 the best peeling tools in the entire game:

His ult sweeps from behind him and pushes units away, peeling for his entire backline. It's realistically impossible for a melee to dodge this except for things like zed ult and fizz e.

His e q combo is one of the farthest dashes in the entire game AND it gives him a shield. He is literally ungankable after level 3 if the Azir is any good.

Any adc would kill for either of these self-peeling tools, but Azir gets 2 of them.

And then there is the Shurima Shuffle, I'm sure you already know of how powerful this is, it single handedly wins games, it's one of the strongest engages in the game.

TL;DR: 1035 range AOE auto attacks✔️ 2 of the best peeling abilities in the entire game on the same champion✔️ One of the most powerful engages in the game✔️ Ungankable✔️ Lane-bully and scaling✔️

That is why Azir is completely broken and shouldn't exist.

Now you try it with your favorite champ!

Reddit,Champion-Specific Issues,champion buff,leagueoflegends,"The healing abuse issue remains, Grievous Wounds item buffs only ruin kit healers like Soraka, while champions like Yone still ignore it.","The healing abuse issue remains, Grievous Wounds item buffs only ruin kit healers like Soraka, while champions like Yone still ignore it. This has been talked about again and again, and while I will concede that Omnivamp items had that aspect of them nerfed, there are still champions that are healing ridiculous amounts and ignoring Grievous Wounds despite those changes. And I'm not talking about champions with healing in their kit, like Soraka and Zac, I'm talking about champions with DPS that can proc lifesteal and omnivamp so much that they heal more than Soraka, such as Yone and Yasuo.

Grievous Wounds items have been buffed, and it seems Riot intends to treat anti-healing as a regular stat, except that is probably the long and complicated way to deal with the issue (assuming that its even dealt with in the first place), which will only lead to a lot of players being frustrated until the end. I don't understand why its so hard to see how this choice is problematic.

The comparison between Grievous Wounds and other stats is, by itself, quite absurd. If I'm a mage, I have multiple items for mana, health, AP, ability haste, health, but if I want anti-healing, there is only one item for me, which means that I have to force myself to buy the item, and considering how prevalent healing is, this basically kills build variety, because I need to give up one slot every match for that one specific item, even if I just build Oblivion Orb.

And that is not to mention the fact that there is a terrible unbalance between the champions that get countered by the Grievous Wounds effect. Go back to the examples I mentioned before, Soraka has healing in her Q (for herself), her W, and her R. Soraka's Q costs mana, has a cooldown and is a quite slow projectile that can be dodged. Soraka's W costs health, mana and has a cooldown. Soraka's R costs mana and has a very long cooldown. Because her healing has intervals, she suffers a lot from anti-heal because the main aspect of her kit isn't available all the time and when it is, it gets reduced.

Now lets look at Yone. Yone has an incredibly high DPS, and thus can proc lifesteal and omnivamp in his basic attacks and his Q all the time. Because he can stack a lot of both stats, he will be getting massive healing from each attack, with no intervals, which means that while Grievous Wounds is reducing his healing, he is still healing a lot for a longer time, meaning that the anti-heal effect isn't going to prevent him from recovering his health quite easily. That is not healthy, Yone has high DPS, a shield, two dashes with knockups and an in-out movement ability in his E. Tell me, then, why should Yone have more sustain than Soraka, an actual healer, when he has so much to bring already? I'm not saying that he should not have any lifesteal, but I do think he should not have so much lifesteal that he becomes a hyper-mobile drain tank. Another thing to not is that Yasuo isn't far behind either, he heals just as much, while having a lot of mobility, damage and CC in his kit, not to mention the wind wall. Another little thing, if you want to argue that these champions maybe don't have a high winrate, remember that they are picked a lot by players that want to make plays, but realistically can't, which ends up leading to them only feeding, ""banning Yasuo because an ally wants to pick it"" was treated as a meme, but it was a real thing.

And this is so unhealthy too, it baffles me how it wasn't changed already. This kind of playstyle basically removed any mage that relies on poking from mid lane. Has anyone noticed that? Champions like Xerath have been kicked from their own lane and forced into the support role (and Xerath is a quite mediocre support too) because even if they poke the enemy, they will just heal it all back in the minion wave, because its just that easy to completely undo the damage in such a passive way. And Xerath isn't the only example of this either, its kind of a meme how many mages ended up as mediocre supports because they're even worse in mid.

One of the main roots of this issue is, of course, Ravenous Hunter. I have no idea why this rune was not nerfed yet, even if you argue that its meant to make champions have ""playmaking potential"", they can still have playmaking potential, their players will just have to learn when it actually take risks. It makes no sense that the tree that claims to be meant for burst damage has an option that outclasses all other sustain runes, besides why is the Domination tree's last row the only one of all trees (correct me if I'm wrong) to have four options instead of three? Just remove Ravenous, easy enough, the very existance of this rune is illogical. Taste of Blood is enough for sustain, at least it actually requires you to interact with your enemy instead of a minion wave, while Ravenous just requires a few assists. At least lifesteal items require those champions to spend gold.

Either that or just make Grievous Wounds more effective against omnivamp/lifesteal, like, maybe making those stats weaker the more they use it or something and even then, that will still leave the problem of players not having the build variety they were promised, because they're forced to build anti-heal every game instead of it being a situational counter-measure. If the buffs to Grievous Wounds continue, all we'll see is champions like Soraka get absolutely buried until the anti-heal effect finally becomes close to decent against the likes of Yone, which seems like too much of a hassle for me when you can just go through the shortest route and deal with the root of the issue, allowing more champions to be played in mid and not get nullified by a playstyle that has turned many players away.

**TL;DR:** Buffing Grievous Wounds is still weakening the champions that don't need that, like Soraka, while not addressing champions that abuse healing, like Yone, not to mention that forcing players to always build Grievous Wounds goes against the idea of build variety. Ravenous Hunter is one of the roots of this issue, champions like Yone don't need to be drain tanks to be effective, and said playstyle has kicked several champions out of mid.",3025,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/lmnpxg/the_healing_abuse_issue_remains_grievous_wounds/,1613657777.0,-0.8272

This wouldn't be a problem if the balance design wasn't dumbed down to global Winrate of all ELOs **combined**.

Imagine the outrage if the same logic was applied to SR/Ranked, demonstrated with Rengar as example:  
Rengar WR for Master+: \~52.5%  Pretty good spot, if not a little too strong right?  
Rengar WR for Silver:  45% Oof seems people struggle piloting him.  
Rengar WR for All Ranks: 46% ""Clearly"" he is underperforming and in dire need of buffs.

Riot's Solution:

\- Decreased Damage taken by 10%  
\- Increased Healing received by 20%  
\- Increased Tenacity by 20%  


Even the people who would benefit from those buffs would find it beyond insane, at the very least, because it would land their main champ in the perma-ban category each game.

I just can't wrap my head around why Riot would choose to hard-buff difficult Champions with the background of ""Seems like lower rank players don't have the skill to play difficult Champions well, so we will buff the Champion to balance it out"".  
A Bronze LB in ARAM will W into the enemy team but somehow miss everyone, throw a random Q on a tank, spike the E into a minion (the R too) and forget to W back before eating 5 Heartsteel procs from the enemy.  
A \~Plat LB who has a basic sense of her kit will 100-0 a full MR Galio from one of the Bushes/Blindspots with a mere Void Staff.

Surprise! You were woken up at Riot's HQ and hired as a member of the balance team. Your job? Prepare balance patches for preseason 12! This may seem a little normal at first, but you were given the limitation of 'no number changes are allowed.'

Here's what is considered as a number change:

- Base Stats

- Skill Ratios (and base numbers) 

- Mana/Energy costs (and refunds) 

- CDR (and cdr resets) 

- Duration of Effect

- Animation speed (and cast time) 

- Movement Speed

- Range

Here's an example of a no-numbers change that buffs a champion:

- Urgot' s R (Fear Beyond Death) can now target towers and execute them if they're in his ult's execution threshold.

And here's an example of a no-numbers change that nerfs a champion:

- Aatrox's E (Umbral Dash) no longer resets his autoattack.

this is bad approach to any champion design and game design especially that this game is PvP not a PvE one.

you can have all champions be overpowered if the receiving end is the environment and not a real person playing the game. you can allow yasuo to ult someone globally if the enemy isn't a real player or it will be very unfun to play against and this will allow for very unhealthy gameplay.

most players complaining don't know that these weaknesses are made to give opponents room to play the game.

some mordekaiser players want abilities to hit faster, because they are too slow vs dashes and mobile enemies. but did they realize that there are champions that don't have dashes?  
and does a strong champion at level 1 should be stat checking all other champions from beginning to full build?   
some champions are designed to fall off at some point or scale up at certain point. the falling ones should use their earl power to create a lead and snowball it, while the scaling ones should avoid any losses and play it safer till they reach their powerspike.

some warwick players want his W to not get disabled when being hit by enemy champion. again this is removal of counterplay to the champion.   
if warwick is running with 35% up to 137.5% bonus movement speed towards an enemy without any counterplay, this will be extremely unhealthy for the game as you are just getting outrun by enemy warwick after trading with your opponent and die.

also simple buffs like 5/10 movement speed exist and +10 damage buffs exist, +30 HP buff exists too. some champions are getting weaker with time but not in absolute need for a rework or major update like players want.

example for champions that got updates and were nerfed many many times afterwards because they wanted to see them in higher elos.  
J4 was buffed by adding AD% scaling to his W resulted in him getting nerfed many times because of that.  
amumu 2 Q stacks resulted in him being nerfed many times after the buff, he went to support role then got nerfed again because he was too good at what he does.  
master yi choosing where to land after his Q and the many on hits on his Q were followed by nerfs too.  
rammus self slow removal led to him suffering so many nerfs because he can just run with the W on and chase enemies hitting them with autos that scale with armor.

if you fail to make a play that you want to with your champion, you can check if it's possible to do it in first place instead of blaming your champion for being X years old and new ones can do it better.   
maybe you are running at someone in safe position already despite him being low HP and you get your speed towards him.  
maybe you should hold your Q as morde if enemy dash is up.

Reddit,Pro Play Balance Impact,pro play meta,leagueoflegends,"Yone is broken for at least 6 patches for challengers, dominates pro play and gets buffed regardless. ","Yone is broken for at least 6 patches for challengers, dominates pro play and gets buffed regardless.  Every data is from [https://lolalytics.com/lol/yone/build/?patch=14.19](https://lolalytics.com/lol/yone/build/?patch=14.19) (just make sure oyu change patch and rank)

For challengers he was:

* 5th most played mid laner in 14.12
* 5th most played mid laner in 14.13
* 5th most played mid laner in 14.14
* 3rd most palyed mid laner in 14.15

* 2nd most palyed mid laner in 14.17 (smolder mid had 1% bigger pick rate)
* **The number 1** most palyed mid laner in 14.18 -> *bruiser build with stride became a thing*
* **The number 1** most palyed mid laner in 14.19 -> 5th most picked champion in all 5 roles. (4th is rell, 3rd is jhin, 2nd is viego, 1st is kaisa)

This is not a popularity case.

If a champion is popular in challenger it means it's really really strong and borderline OP. Funny that stridebreaker was only caught up in 14.18. Before that Yone was building botrk into crit and was doing well...

Lets analyse what makes Yone strong:

* He has a flex (mostly played on mid...),
* He is an AD mid, making Aurora and Rumble better choices for pro
* Relly safe into most picks right now and especially good into mages
* Good, flexible items with great power spike
* Ultimate is an engage and disengage spell
* Q3 rlly solid for pro play

For a long time BotRK is a staple 1st item. Why? BECAUSE HIS CRITS ITEMS ARE THRASH!!!

* Yone needs Attack Speed way more than crit
* Yone builds Immortal Shieldbow and Infinity Edge. Neither of these has Attack Speed
* Blade of the Ruined King has AD, Attack Speed, Life Steal and its ability allows him to fight with tank and squishies.

Buffing his crit was a measily excuse to deliver another buff to an already popular and strong pick for no real reason.

Over time, the game's focus has shifted from solo carry to more team-oriented gameplay. This change has led to an increase in skirmishes, such as 2v2, 2v3, 3v3, and 3v4 fights.

* The trend towards higher champion durability has affected champions like Yone and Yasuo. They can no longer easily pick off squishy targets or dominate 1v1 situations as they used to.
* In the past, these champions could outplay opponents by dealing significantly more damage while being much more vulnerable themselves. However, this playstyle has become less effective in the current meta.

There came the Stridebreaker?

* AD, ATTACK SPEED, 450 Health.
* It slows enemies hit by it's active by 35% and GRANTS Yone 35% MS for each enemy hit for 3 seconds

TL;DR Yone is squishy but extremely opressing and pressuring champion with mixed damage, with 2 different knockups, ghosted movement speed boost and shield. Bruiser builds allows him to deal similar damage while allowing him to stay in combat for longer because it eliminates his biggest weakness. No other champion with such a high priority and success rate in challenger and 93% presence in pro play are supposed to recevie a buff after an item he build 3rd or 4th recevies 200 gold nerf...

Reddit,Pro Play Balance Impact,pro play meta,leagueoflegends,Why did Thresh become bad in pro play?,"Why did Thresh become bad in pro play? I saw the Elise post and thought I could ask the same about Thresh. I started watching pro play in 2020 and Thresh was a fairly common pick then. Keria's Thresh made me a fan of him.

However it seems like Thresh never sees play any more. Since I started watching, a lot of champs cycle in and out of pro. There's pro play staples that never seem to leave like Ksante, Azir, Kalista, but there's also champs that are never super high presence but pop in every once in a while like Nocturne, Lulu, Cassio. I wouldn't be surprised if a team picked one of those champs.

But with Thresh, I would be surprised since it feels like I just haven't seen him in so long. I watch mostly LCK (some LEC/LCS) so maybe I'm missing games where he's picked.

The explanation I can think of is that Theesh seems to be paired with immobile hyper carries, like Aphelios and Jinx. And maybe for the longest time bot meta has either been mobile ADCs (Lucian/Zeri) or non-hypercarry lane prio ADCs (Kalista/Cait/Varus).

So is Thresh not picked because ADC meta doesn't suit him? Or because he's just weak and has been for the past 3 years? Or for some other reason? Thresh has often been listed here as a champ that has a well-designed kit, and one that's exciting to watch too, so I hope he can return.",1394,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1gk7vgp/why_did_thresh_become_bad_in_pro_play/,1730816699.0,0.9778

I'm Pekin Woof, I tried to go pro for many years and after not making it to LCS turned to making content. Thankfully I grew enough to now do content full time. Nearly all of my content is educational commentaries and after doing it for so long I wanted to change things a little bit by making a series of climbing with Off-Meta/Strange picks to Masters. I didn't really know how long it would take but I managed to get Masters very quickly and many people who watched it thought I should continue the series to Challenger. During the Masters Climb I played as many new things as possible including AP Nami Mid and AP Sona Mid which are 2 of my favorite Champions I managed to pull off (I legit 1 shot 100 to 0 with a single Sona auto attack).

Once I got to Grandmasters I had to make a Champ pool of consistent Off-Meta picks so I had way less variety of Champions like AP Kog'maw, AP Ezreal, Warwick Mid, Poppy Mid, Nunu Mid, Elise Mid, and Lillia Mid. I still did some weird picks on occasion (One of my final climb videos was two AD Ahri Mid games).


So that is a brief summary of the climb, here is the account which has since reaching Challenger fallen back to Grandmaster by 2 LP. https://www.op.gg/summoners/na/kirby%20with%20hair

I think riots design direction of making champs that are good at everything cough (samira, aphelios, zoe, viego, yone, release sett, pantheon etc etc) are BORING and tiring to watch because you have the natural tendency to expect the outplay because their kits are conducive towards outplaying their oponents.

I think its a breath of fresh air and also funny as hell to watch a champ that has lower res textures than a caster minion absolutely run like an ape at mach 10 and stun the crap out of the enemy team and then run out emoting m'pengu. Feels good man. You dont need one million dashes to smurf or invulnerability or a stupid mobile windwall. If champs have a solid identity where they are good at one thing they will be played in SoloQ and Pro play. I hope simple champs keep getting the spotlight because it is a spit on the face of the designers leading league away from what it was originally a fun moba.

What do you guys think?

Reddit,Pro Play Balance Impact,pro play meta,leagueoflegends,What makes Akali unique as the only viable assassin in pro play?,"What makes Akali unique as the only viable assassin in pro play? I'm infatuated with watching fantastic Akali players.

Faker, Caps, even Perkz Akali was pretty fire recently.

And it got me thinking - what makes Akali unique relative to Fizz, Zed, Katarina etc? I guess Leblanc is also an assassin mage hybrid who sees pro play.

But once upon a time Zed and Fizz were even pro play picks. Especially Zed who was the meta defining pick in season 3.

So in season 14 what separates Akali from her class counterparts? Why can Akali see success even at the highest level of competition where communication and coordination are present?

Imo it mostly comes down to 2 factors.

1. Akali can side lane better than most other assassins. When is the last time you saw a Fizz 1v1 an equally fed Jax in the side lane? Akali can not only survive but thrive in the sidelane which is an absolute must for pro play.

2. Akali has more options and ways to approach a skirmish or teamfight. Where an assassin like Fizz gets hard countered by a zhonyas or an exhaust or an enchanter's utility, Akali's damage is spread out over time and Akali can stall fights with her mobility and W allowing her to be a much bigger nuisance in mid-late game teamfights than other assassins.

It seems to me these factors make Akali pro play viable as an asssassin which imo is really fun to watch since this class has been a pro play rarity since season 3-4",1529,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1adrme0/what_makes_akali_unique_as_the_only_viable/,1706521637.0,0.9724

Reddit,Pro Play Balance Impact,worlds balance,leagueoflegends,Warwick Changes were a mistake 14.22,"Warwick Changes were a mistake 14.22 So, as a Warwick main that has played the champion almost everyday for 7 years with around 4000 hours, and being one of the best Warwick players in the world I can safely say

Warwick is clunkier than ever

His hitbox changes were made in 14.9 from 55-65, making him lose his slippery yordle hitbox and now with the recent changes his model size got increased by 15%, but the thing about Warwick is his base stats are trash. Other champions like Illaoi, Olaf and Urgot make sense since their base stats are very high and they are not easy to kill. Warwicks main counterplay to this weakness is his E which has a high dmg reduction but a high cooldown meaning you peel/stay alive for long. So either reverse the changes to what they were or give us better stats.

Warwick Q hasn't even gotten touched despite the fact that it's probably the buggiest ability in the game rn, sometimes acting like a hold when tapping or vice versa, not avoiding knock ups during it's animations, sometimes the ability goes on cd when enemies walk into bushes making you lose mana and deal no dmg thus healing nada.

Warwick W changes have not even been mentioned in the patch notes and it is now showing the wrong information, it mentioned that abilities will now be able to proc the AS from W and the AS lingers for 1 sec which at first would make any ww main go ""Oh, so they make Warwick play smoother"". Nope, what they instead did is they made Warwick W not give any attack speed at all in the first hit, making his farming under turret extremely vulnerable, waveclear feels clunky, and trading shortly with champions has become an actual pain. And his W attack speed and movement speed bonuses have decreased, they no longer triple when targets get below 20%, they now only double when enemies get below 25%. But still holding onto hope we thought we were getting our out of combat ms work in combat to not get cancelled by enemy champions unless we are the ones to hit them, that is how it was in pbe, that is how it is in the tooltip, but no it isn't there.

Warwick E lock out getting halved from 0.5 to 0.25 is a placebo buff, in reality, you can actually cancel the animation of E2 by simply Q'ing and then using E2 right after. But if you decide to try that now you will instead be greeted by one of Warwicks Q bugs that made his Q act like a hold no matter how lightly and fast you will tap the ability, but now that bug skyrocketed increasing the chance of that to happening from about 10-20% to about 80-90% test it in practice tool.

Warwick R changes, this is a mixed bag for me as it is nice to have your ultimate finally not have the width of Yasuo Q anymore (I wish I was joking) 80 vs 100 units of width on Warwick R that is now 150. They also removed the Warwick R hitbox at the back, which is a good change that adds skill expression and makes Warwick good at fleeing instead of hitting the enemies that are touching the tip of your tail. But they went absolutely overboard with it as champions that are right up your a#& or inside of you, will not get hit by the Warwick ultimate unless your cursor is directly on top of them. It also seems that for the few frames of jumping you cannot actually hit stuff making it very easy to miss your ultimate when a champion is directly next to you

But anyway I would simply like to say that these arcane season 2 ""buffs"" need to get reverted, they have made Warwick. A champion that has already felt extremely clunky even clunkier than before.

So I would like to give my opinions on what the Warwick changes should look like

1. I think Warwick should get straight up buffs without any nerfs to his kit, I'm not gonna lie Warwick is extremely weak in the jungle and he is not that strong top lane (unless you abuse barrier in diamond). I think it is kind of disgusting for Warwick to get AD/AP scaling to his passive 4 years ago due to him obviously falling out of meta, and 1 year ago we got buffs to his Q dealing extra damage to monsters, and W getting less cd and more ms, since Warwick jungle was actually pathetic at the time compared to every other jungler that can waveclear 3x times as fast whether it's a single camp like gromp, or the you will need to buy tiamat for this aka raptors.
2. Warwick should receive lots of bugfixes, this one is a no brainer as Warwicks spaghetti code has been breaking in lots of places, in this season Warwicks gotten a bug that makes his W not give him any movement speed against low targets whether it's the passive or the active, and it doesn't give you vision of enemies that have walked into bushes, or are recalling in said bushes, this happens about 5-10% of the time now but it is game changing. Warwick Q is getting more inconsistent with every patch. And Warwick E hitbox is still dragging behind harder than Santas ballsack in july when using Q to follow targets thus making your fear miss while latching onto a target that has used a blink/dash ability.
3. Every champ besides Warwick has received so much love over the years with constant buffs, and mini reworks with minimal if any drawback whatsoever. Like actually go look at champs like Gnar and Kennen that has received like 9 buffs in the past 5 years that were not small by any stretch of the imagination. Fiora, Gragas, Jax, Riven, And recently Irelia have gotten insane buffs to their splitpushing removing any counterplay to them. Bullies like Jayce, Darius, Garen, Renekton, and Urgot have received so many buffs that it is insane. And Warwick has gotten barely any love because we have to think about low elo guys, when champions like Garen and Trundle are 10x worse there. But there is also a fair point when addressing the Warwick top barrier abusers for which I don't think are that problematic when they fall off a cliff after laning phase without teleport, or any good items that actually scale. So I think it's fair to throw the dog a bone every now and then
4. Everyone knows how easy it is to counter Warwick. And People act like he doesn't have any counterplay since they hate Warwick because of 3 things, his early game sustain, his Q latch mechanics that makes everyone mad when they flash and Warwick is still biting their ass, and the barrier abusers on top getting ultra fed early and ending the game because in diamond and below, if you win laning phase you win the game. But I digress, anyway, everyone knows to just buy oblivion orb and Warwick can get easily poked out and die now since everyone one shots the other champ, Warwick W movement speed is out of combat and his base movement speed is 335 meaning if you hit him once he goes 100-0 real quick, usually gets kited, and dies. Warwick R was incredibly easy to dodge since it had a shit hitbox that made every WW main look like a first timer when they miss an ultimate, and what's even funnier, everyone knows how easy it is to cancel Warwick ultimate by yourself with the most basic of abilites, Garen Q, TF stun, Udyr E, Vel'koz E, Hwei fear, Fiddle Q/E, Cho'gath Q/W, Darius E ect. Champions with long windup animations can time their abilities at the last moment to just shrug off Warwick by themselves, which is something riot has actually removed in the past, when every Singed player started using E on Warwick and always flipped them out of their ult, just check the patch notes.

With that being said I will now go over the Warwick buff that I believe our doggo deserves

How to actually fix Warwick (Don't add all of these changes just some of them except for bug fixes)

\- Reduce Warwicks hitbox and size to what it used to be since Warwicks base stats suck, or increase his base stats... a lot

\- Increase Warwicks base ms speed by 5 it made sense 7 years ago when champs didnt have 4 dashes, Movement speed buffs, and incredible base stats

\- Make Q deal AOE dmg against monsters

\- Change W movement speed so when you get hit you will lose about 80% of the current movement speed instead of going from 100-0 also it has a 0-3.5 ramp up

\- Make Warwick E deal damage to monsters so that junglers can actually use this ability against camps (active or passive maybe bami cinder mini passive against monsters)

\- Make Warwick R not get cancelled by the enemy champions basic abilites (everyone knows how to counter this now)

\- Make Warwick R cost less mana from 100 to all ranks to 100-50-0 lvl 6-11-16 (Warwick got left behind with the sheen changes and didn't receive buff to his mana 10.23

I believe Warwick jungle takes priority as his waveclear is ass without tiamat, and even with it is lackluster. Warwick top should receive some smaller buffs maybe AD, MS, Ressistances, or HP.

BUG FIXES

HIGH PRIORITY

\- Fix Warwick Q acting like a hold when tapping and vice versa

\- Fix Warwick Q going on cd, losing mana, not dealing dmg, and not healing when enemy targets walk into bushes

\- Fix Warwick Q sometimes getting cc'd by knockups mid animation

\- Fix Warwick W MS so that it doesn't bug out and not give you any movement speed on both passive and activ

\- Fix Warwick E hitbox when Q'ing through targets so it actually hits people around instead of following your model with a delay thus making the fear not hit at all

\- Fix Warwick R so you don't just stand there for 1.5 seconds when a champion uses an orange, Olaf ult, or Qss,(RELEASE ME)

\- Fix Warwick R so that it cannot get cancelled by basic abilites like Garen Q, Darius, E, Fiddle Q/E ect. But it can get cancelled by ultimate abilities like Gragas R, Qyiana R, Malphite R etc ( no idea how they would impliment this but it would be the most fair thing to do IMO) EDIT! I meant basic abilities from the target you are currently ulting not every basic ability, teammates like Rell, and Leona would still be able to cc you out of the target Ww is ulting. That would be really stupid as it would remove counterplay and I'm sorry for causing confusion in the comment threads.

MID PRIORITY

\- Fix Warwick Q healing after you are dead (maybe make it's damage animation speed based on attack speed)

\- Fix Warwick W attack speed for real this time, no need to use tiamat after getting a target low to receive the bonus upon getting enemies below 50% and 20% right after, or pressing S and then clicking on it again, or clicking on ground and then on target

\- Warwick E hitbox being really bad at fearing people behind Warwick (I'm not insane everyone else is)

Anyways this is a lot longer than I thought it would be. Thank you for actually paying attention to the ramblings of a madman, it means a lot. I just feel so disappointed with these changes and wanted to get them off my chest while also adding my reasoning, and thoughts on what Warwick actually needs.

I hope you all have a good day.

Edit: it seems that Warwick is broken in more ways than I even thought, looking at the Warwick main subreddit which is rn overflowing with bugs from the new changes, and every Ww main/player hating these changes (roughly 90% of them) agree that Ww feels more clunky, buggy, and less satisfying overall. With every non ww player/main barely reading this post and typing stuff like ""Finally Warwick is balanced"" and stuff like that. Anyways I would like to thank all of you, even the not so supportive part of community for bringing awareness to this issue.

2nd Edit: the changes have been now live for a while now and it has done exactly what I've feared it would do, Make Warwick a crazy good right clicking stat checker in low elo both in jgl and top (with barrier abusers taking most of the credit), that falls off mid-late game. And absolutely useless in higher levels of play. Warwick has now cemented his fate to always be a right clicking. Barrier Relying. Clunky. Buggy. Stat checker.

Reddit,Pro Play Balance Impact,worlds balance,leagueoflegends,An in depth look into Riven and why her popularity has been destroyed by commitment to a mechanic you probably don't understand,"An in depth look into Riven and why her popularity has been destroyed by commitment to a mechanic you probably don't understand https://lolalytics.com/lol/riven/build/

She is now at 3% popularity in emerald+ and negative win rate, but has no room for buffs.

https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/riven

She used to be at 25% popularity. She is a fun 1v9 carry champion that is seemingly perfect for a popular pick, combining high damage, mobility , button mashing, a high skill cap and being conventionally attractive with plenty of skins, 

**So what happened?** 

- A large % is going to be lots of new flashy champions released since 2015, but that is still post yasuo and other similar era champions have kept much better % played stats. 

- People got too good at her, and riot had to start balancing around the best riven players. Not a death sentence for sure, champions like lee sin survived this just fine. 

**BUT**

Riven is **too difficult** for a reasonable league of legends champion because of one mechanic, **fast q**.

Take a look at this riven mains post (from 7 years ago)
https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3xgbrv/riven_combos_and_animation_canceling_guide/

There are 10s of different combos for every situation , I just want to say, COOL THIS IS FINE .

Whenever you try and talk about Riven and removing this mechanic, people start thinking you want to hit **ANIMATION CANCELLING**, which is absolutely not the case. Yes it takes some work getting into, and some champions like Nidalee and Sylas had them removed, but this is absolutely not the problem with Riven.

So what is the problem?

**FAST Q**

It sounds simple enough, here is a guide
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY0tPpw7I2Y

What it means however is a massive dps difference in using Riven's combo intuitively - weaving autos between spells, and using this ""bug"" button mashing around Riven constantly to make her attack quicker. It feels like 1000s of gold worth of attack speed it's so big the difference. You frankly cannot play Riven in a competitive game without doing it, she is balanced around it and to avoid being stat checked you have to. 

You might answer, durrr just git gud, practise it. But the thing is that doing this through a game in every single situation combining with all the other combos is so hard even **pro toplaners pros do not consider learning Riven to be worth it**. There have been many metas were Riven has been viable and seen pro play, but only a handful of pros will bring her out. 

**The fix** 

It was actually fixed for a patch as Riot was testing out removing fast q before, Riven instantly became way more popular as people could actually access closer to her full strength without months in the practise tool.

You just make Riven like every other champion, no benefit to clicking really quickly behind her between every auto...

**But I like this mechanic stop making the game too easy!**

No you don't, this mechanic is done by like 10 people in the world at a consistent level in every game. Riven would keep a high skill cap but just not an obnoxious skill gap gated by starcraft level clicking. Which leads me to...

**IT ISN'T FUN**

To play Riven at a level she is balanced around, you have to click hundreds of times more than a jax player. This isn't about game knowledge, kill thresholds, combos or things that make most ""difficult"" champions have a high skill gap, it's just mechanical clicking that 99.9% of riven ""mains"" don't do properly anyway.

**Why has Riot not changed this already**

Community outcry, seriously. Mostly by Silver Riven mains who think Riot would be removing simple animation cancels like e-w.

Also the ""not a bug it's a feature"" was talking about Riven's ability to jump over walls with q3, which was kept as a cool mechanic. Fast q is an abomination of game design separate to this. 

Ultimately if you like Riven at all, you should support this as removing it let's riot actually buff her to be playable outside of grandmaster+ 1 tricks.",4067,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/17t03iy/an_in_depth_look_into_riven_and_why_her/,1699726239.0,0.9979

The boys showed excellent discipline and were fully committed to the adventure. We had this common belief that we were on a great mission, and it scaled pretty well.

Reddit,Pro Play Balance Impact,worlds balance,leagueoflegends,Riot Phroxzon on the State of Assassins,"Riot Phroxzon on the State of Assassins Phroxzon [tweeted](https://twitter.com/RiotPhroxzon/status/1708642020536004649):

>I wanted to make this post about Assassins, not to defend any specific points, but to give some more transparency for how we currently think about assassins if people want to read it. 

>Similar to fighters, there aren't a lot of things we can give assassins that all players are going to be happy with, so we need to make some tradeoffs somewhere

>1 Pattern Power Budget Tuning

>- We balance assassins around 3 patterns.

> a. Luxury (ekko W/R, Zed triple shuriken, LeBlanc QRW, Talon melee Q full combo, Evelynn W, Fizz M+ R, etc.)

>- These are patterns that cannot be done unless champ is extremely ahead or opponent is in lower MMR brackets. They tend to scale poorly with MMR (LeBlanc in high ELO is unlikely to land many QRW’s on a priority target, whereas ADCs are much more likely to be hit by them in lower MMR).

>- Luxury patterns are still great to have, even though they can be impractical, because they result in awesome high moments, especially for the majority of players in average skill who will land them more often. 

> b. Standard Combo (LB W (gap close) -> RQE or W -> EQR/QRE, Talon ranged Q, Zed 2 Shurikens). 

>- We want to have moments of gameplay in this combo (like proccing Leblanc Sigil), but not as much as a luxury combo.

>- While we try to have as much moment to moment gameplay in these combos, some assassins are tuned more around playing the strategic game (eg. not being isolated against Rengar or Naafiri). 

>- There’s a significant amount of gameplay that goes into approaching a target that is primarily unnoticed by opponents.

>- We try to have as much power funneled into Assassin’s (gameplay button(s)), so that the snowballing scales with counterplay

> c. Low counterplay Combo (eg. Qiyana EQWQ, Leblanc W -> QR). These combos aren’t expected to kill unless the assassin is very ahead

>- Assassins need to be tuned around their standard combo killing for the game to function properly (especially in higher levels of play), to avoid an overly dominant bot focused or mid mage meta. 

>- We have lived in worlds where Assassins need to land luxury combos to kill and there is far too much counterplay to keep squishy classes balanced (especially when you account for peel from Enchanters and Tanks). 

>- It’s just not possible for Ruler playing ADC to realistically die (or any other high MMR ADC) when you have to hit him with Ekko’s W, Leblanc’s QRW, Fizz R or Zed’s triple shuriken to kill him. The game’s fundamental rock paper scissors dynamics ceases to function. 

>- Would be open to finding a way for Assassins to be tuned around hitting ""Luxury Combos"" in low MMR, but ""Standard Combo"" in high MMR, just haven't found a good way to do that just yet

>2 Assassin Power Curves

>- Assassins need to be strong early game, but not so strong that if they snowball out of lane, other roles don’t have a say

>- The main issue I see with a world where assassins are a pure early game class (feast or famine) is if Qiyana snowballs lane and goes 3-0 (which we would expect to happen a lot if Assassins are super strong early game), ADC/other squishies don’t have agency to affect how Qiyana performs in lane and are likely to get hunted constantly with little recourse

>- Agency of mid and jg assassins in this world would grow significantly when mid/jg are already the two highest agency roles

>- For this reason, we tune Assassins to be ~above average early game (rather than very strong), strong midgame and weaker in the late game (there are exceptions)

>- This also depends on the skill bracket; most assassins are quite weak levels 1-6 in higher levels of play, whereas they are strong in average play at these levels.

>3 Haste on Assassin Items

>- Assassins need to have a reasonable average performance. While many ADC players would prefer if Assassins were 40% winrate, that’s not a class worth playing or able to do it’s role in League

>- The more outputs an assassin can offer to the team when behind means that when they snowball, their burst damage isn't so overbearing that there’s enough agency for other roles to fight back (less feast or famine). It’s a balancing act; we want them to be able to carry the game when ahead, but it can easily go overboard

>- Non-damage stats on assassin items or a champion's AR/HP/MR per level allow us to bolster their winrates, without sending their burst damage overboard

>- Haste on Assassin items is what we use to avoid these one-shot or be one-shot metas, which allows Assassins to lean more on their utility spells and ultimates while behind, so they don’t need to be so overbearing when ahead to avoid the agency and counterplay issues associated with this

>- Haste on items also means that in the case that an assassin does snowball, we have a balancing lever to make sure that “standard combos” don’t degrade into “low counterplay combos” too quickly

>- If Duskblade didn’t have Haste on it, it would be an 80 AD, 18 Leth item, instead of 60 AD, 18 Leth. It is really difficult to tune “standard combos” to scale with counterplay appropriately when each item will spike your pure burst damage by this much.

>- We don’t want burst damage to be so low that Assassins are opting into Goredrinker and things like that, but we consider items like Black Cleaver to be items that assassins pick up sometimes (especially for some of our more spell oriented assassins)

>- The downside of using non-damage stats (like Haste) as a balancing lever however, is that like now, there will be a lot of complaints around mage builds, however I think this is mostly a Zed issue (and we agree Zed needs to be made less magey long term)

>- I still think it's better than having one-shot or be one-shot meta. We don't want to turn assassins into mages or bruisers, but having some Haste is still valuable (agree that Mythic passives are providing too much though)

>- Ideally, if a build is high Haste, it probably sacrifices some up front burst. That tradeoff may not be manifesting correctly in all places right now, but in my opinion, isn't a problem with the underlying idea, but more about specifically how it's tuned right now

>- Duskblade being stronger than Eclipse or Youmuus on many AD assassins is contributing to a good amount of this and things hopefully get better post Preseason when single items aren’t giving really high amounts of Haste due to the Mythic passive

>4 Base Damage vs Ratios

>- Bases need to be low and bAD (bonus AD ratio) high to prevent bruiser builds like Talon is going right now (and we’ll want to follow up on him at some point). 

>- We use bAD to be able to use a higher ratio number (bAD ratios are higher than tAD) and have fine control over their scaling of levels vs items.

>- Assassins need to have some natural scaling from base damages however. Bases should be at the optimal value so that assassins are not just a pure early game class because this will skyrocket their agency too much

>- If bases are too low, then for these Champs to have a reasonable average performance, their ratios will need to be higher to account for that, but they can’t be so high that if Zed snowballs 3-0 out of lane, bot cannot play.

>- So the bases need to be high enough that an assassin can do their job, even when they’re not snowballing, but not so high that they still kill squishies while quite behind. This is a tough balance, but is still ongoing",2686,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/16xiatj/riot_phroxzon_on_the_state_of_assassins/,1696207306.0,0.8685

Fiddlesticks in Chinese server can 6 camps full clear under 2:49 on the top side of the map but not possible in other servers.,"Patch 13.10 made subtle jungle camp patience difference between Chinese server and other servers. Fiddlesticks in Chinese server can 6 camps full clear under 2:49 on the top side of the map but not possible in other servers. **UPDATE: The ""bug"" has been fixed, you can no longer double camp red and raptors on CN server.**

In the previous patch 13.9 on top side of the map 3:05 is the timer that Fiddlesticks can hit level 4. However, the point where players can pull red and raptors together is no longer available.

Today I was browsing Bilibili, and noticed a video about Fiddlesticks full clear under 2:49: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Wh411w7pM](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Wh411w7pM) (If you don't have a Bilibili account you can watch this video below)

The video uses the point shown in the image below to pull red and raptors together, ~~and it shows that you can also pull blue and grump together.~~ (According to the comment you can double blue and grump outside CN server)

[The point that you can pull red and raptors together in Chinese server 13.10](https://preview.redd.it/d0s8cmhtaa1b1.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=d44f0860ed9284b78ef2dd685a88c07755a0b428)

I was so excited so I opened LOL (NA server) and started a practice mode to try it out. Surprisingly, it was not possible in NA server to pull those camps together. I tried almost all the points between camps but there was none that could keep patience of both camps.

As expected, this trick does not work in EU server as well. How is this possible? Shouldn't all servers be the same?

Edit: You can double camp blue and grump outside CN server, but has anyone successfully doubled red and raptors following the video posted above?

Reddit,Role-Based Complaints,jungle difference,leagueoflegends,RiotPhroxzon on the PBE lane swap changes,"RiotPhroxzon on the PBE lane swap changes > ""Hi everyone,

> You may have seen the anti-lane swap changes that made their way to PBE today.

> **Changes**

> The changes (as of today) are as follows:

> - Lane Swap Detection

> - 2 enemy champions, both of whom don’t have jungle item, are in the offending lane or surrounding area

> * Timer is 1:30 - 3:30 for top lane and 1:30 - 2:15 for mid lane

> * If the team has no junglers, this rule is disabled

> * If the team has two or more junglers, junglers are included in the check

> - While Detected

> * Defending turret has 95% damage reduction

> * Defending turret one shots minions

> * Defending turret and minions give gold and XP from their kills to the nearest allied champion in the lane

> * Offending champions gain 50% less gold and XP from minions.

> * This lingers for 25 seconds in top lane, 6 seconds in mid lane..

> - Top only:

> * Defending turret one shots champions

> * Defending champion has 50% damage reduction under their turret (~300u range)

> **Temporary Nature**

> These changes are temporary and, by extension, heavy handed by necessity. We intend to work on longer term solutions (similar to how we addressed funnel, double support items, etc.) but an elegant solution that solves the problem without adding excess long term rules to the game will take time and we’ll keep these rules in the game until that solution is ready.

> Many viewers and Pros alike have expressed that lane swaps undermine something that makes League awesome; that the best top laners can fight the best top laners and the best bot lanes can fight the best bot lanes. As a result, we feel like it is necessary to make these changes at this time.

> These rules are intended to address the most expectation breaking versions of lane swaps starting from level 1, but they are not intended to affect the time periods significantly after that, as swaps at that point provide lower benefits and more closely resemble “normal League of Legends”.

> We want League of Legends played in Pro to look as close as possible to the League of Legends we all play. Due to lane swaps, this is not true for many Pro games right now. While Fearless Draft and Tournament Draft pick/ban might have different rules for regular players and Pros, the actions in game are governed by the same rules.

> **Feedback so far**

> We’ve also seen the comments about this affecting regular play and potential griefers.

> We are trying to strike the best balance between minimizing impact to regular play and maximizing effectiveness in reducing lane swaps in pro play.

> We put a lot of thought into ways that this might manifest in regular play and hit innocent players like level 2 ganking mid, a Twitch or Teemo level 1 ganking with stealth. Ultimately, we didn’t feel like we could effectively eliminate lane swaps without some amount of collateral damage to these strategies, but we are trying to mitigate with things like a shorter duration for these rules in midlane and linger durations so players incidentally pathing through these lanes don’t grief their teammates. As mentioned above, we don’t want this to be the reality forever.

> Finally, we know that bad actors may attempt to use these changes as a testbed for griefing. Simply put, if you engage in this behavior to grief your teammates, we will detect it and punish you.""

""Lane swap detected: please leave the area!"", we might have cooked with how noisy it is * We considered referees enforcing it but what if you have a failed invade top side then Keria walks slightly too close to top on his way out, does the ref pause the game and threaten a yellow card - ""don't take one more step or it's a violation!"". The more we thought about all the edge cases and needing to define them the more impractical it became, as amusing as it'd be to watch""",1818,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1ivadjw/riotphroxzon_on_the_pbe_lane_swap_changes/,1740197993.0,0.9974

Reddit,Role-Based Complaints,jungle difference,leagueoflegends,Naafiri hasn't even reached one year on the rift and she already became the least picked champion in the game,"Naafiri hasn't even reached one year on the rift and she already became the least picked champion in the game [Ziggs mid is less popular but if you combine both Ziggs bot and Ziggs mid, their pickrate is higher than Naafiri](https://preview.redd.it/2psz0nu2ys1d1.png?width=942&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0725c6ee3c8d2889a80b76f07150d746401132e)

Naafiri is a good case on what Riot should avoid in champion design

**1- The end goal was terrible**

*“A while back, our champion design lead, August Browning, did an analysis of our whole roster and categorized each champ by role, class, and difficulty in order to find some opportunity areas for players,” game designer Glenn “Riot Twin Enso” Anderson reveals. “He ended up finding two major holes: a higher skill tank, which ended up being K’Sante, and a relatively simple and beginner-friendly assassin, which became Naafiri.”” -  Naafiri champ insights June 2023*

These were a bit of flawed goals, Tank like K'Sante having so much agency forces him to be permanently bound to being highest presence in pro play despite multiple adjustments, nerfs and reworks so he has to remain as 45% WR while an assassin with literally no skill ceiling gets dropped by mid lane players almost immediately and thus have an abysmal pickrate

**2-""Monster champions have low pickrate"" was used as an excuse to not follow up on Naafiri's post release**

Naafiri was in fact just a check box, community kept asking for a monster champions and Riot wanted to fill the gap in their roster so they just checked both boxes, released the filler champ and moved on to the next project.

They didn't stop to think that maybe the brand new easy/intro champion should at the very minimum have same pickrate as other niche assasins as players should find immediate success when they pick her up

Sure, there is truth to it, if Naafiri had a model that looked like the other darkin champions but female, she would have had higher pickrate but there are also tons of monster champions who are faring well in terms of popularity with much older kits and worse looking models.

**3-Naafiri should have been allowed to jungle**

I can understand why not let her jungle at the first month or two as to push her identity as a mid laner or solo laner but once the dust settled down and mid laners voted with their pickrate  that they don't want to play this absolutely boring kit, Riot should have immediately given some jungle ratios and see how she would fare in the jungle

Riot literally buffed Sylas, Olaf, Zyra, Brand, Sett and others to push them to jungle and attract more pickrate for these champions, but the least popular champion in the game isn't looked at?

I don't see any reason why Naafiri shouldn't have been allowed to jungle, Junglers are more likely to pick up monster champions. If Naafiri would be problematic and very frustrating jungler and get +30% banrate then sure remove her jungle modifiers but at the very least give it a shot and see if her dwindling playerbase would recover from its death spiral

**4- Her kit has an identity issue as she plays like a skirmisher rather than an assassin**

-her engage ability \[W\] is a point and dash that has long channel time and can be blocked by other enemies standing in its path so her back line access is pretty shit specially the higher in MMR you go and enemy team has that knowledge. Diana E for example has the same range of Naafiri until Naafiri hits lvl 11 but she has no cast time and other champions can't block it

the cast time of W gives too much counterplay, any champion with an ounce of hard CC can easily interrupt Naafiri mid dash \[Hwei EQ, Syndra E, Lux Q, etc\]  compare that to the instanteous Diana dash's case where the enemy mid laner has to predict that Diana will dash and throw his CC early to stop Diana mid dash

-she has no escape tools but to compensate she gets shields from her R + on her take downs as well

-The bleed in her kit synergizes with Black Cleaver and Eclipse \[Fighter items\]

-So is she a good skirmisher? not really, she lacks any form of CC whether slows or hard CC, that greatly diminishes her skirmishing

**5- The kit has nothing to master and the narrative is disconnected from the gameplay**

shes literally a nothing burger, she has no skill expression and she gets boring after the third game as her gameplay loop gets very repetitive and boring.

her E is the only redeeming ability in her kit as she dishes out damage at start of the dash and then at the end of the dash, she deals even more damage in an explosion but the fun thing about the abilitiy is that it immediately recalls your dogs and heals them up

her R is you get more dogs and bonus AD + shield, the cool part is that the dogs get a small boost in HP so they could survive getting one shot, I like that part

the champion theme is the pack and half her voice lines are all about unity and how the pack makes her strong and that a lone dog is weak, etc. etc.

where is that pack in her gameplay???

why don't her abilities get some twists depending on how many dogs she has? doesn't have to be more or less numbers in her damage, what makes Naafiri unique from the other 166 champions? its her pack gimmick and nothing else.

**Naafiri has the tools in her kit to protect and heal her pack and but she is punished for protecting her pups as she blows her mana, damage and her cooldown for literally  no gain**

to reiterate, I don't say Naafiri should have been a high skill floor champion but there are lots of champions that have low skill floor and are newbie friendly but also moderate to high skill ceiling to encourage players to main them and not get bored after a few games.

**Closing notes:**

its a shame how Naafiri turned out, her in game model is cool and very different from your average league champion, the dogs AI is smart and I love that they can help you CS and they move smoothly around you, her R animation and sound really sells the whole unleash the pack vibe, the animators, riggers, vfx artists all did a wonderful job.

but the gameplay is horrendous and she is doomed to be the lowest pickrate champ in the game unless she's balanced around having 52% WR and  her pickrate will still be bottom 20 as you can't bribe players with winrate to play this boring ass champion

No other newly released champion in League's history had their pickrate plummet this quickly and sharply after their release

to understand how bad Naafiri pickrate is, it took Rell \~2 years after her release to get the midscope rework and Rell's pickrate pre midscope was higher than current Naafiri.",4054,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1cxdux0/naafiri_hasnt_even_reached_one_year_on_the_rift/,1716313430.0,0.9987

Reddit,Role-Based Complaints,jungle difference,leagueoflegends,"I got an S+ on every champion in the game, and this is what I learned","I got an S+ on every champion in the game, and this is what I learned My name is Azuk, aka Powertwink on the NA server. I've been playing League since 2014, and have hung around Plat for most seasons since S7, though most of my games are in normals.

I'm sure at least some of you are aware of the ""Perfectionist"" challenge, which requires an S+ on every champion in the game to max out. I can't remember exactly when I started actively working at it, but if I had to estimate, it was probably in early/mid 2023. At that time, I think I had accumulated around 20 S+ or so just by playing normally. It was actually in October of 2023 that I finally finished, and became one of two people in NA to complete the challenge:

...and since then, I've kept up with new champion releases to keep the challenge maxed out.

I didn't really share it with anyone at the time, but the other day I thought that some people might find it interesting for me to share a few of the things I learned while doing it.

Firstly, I'd like to touch on what I found was most important in landing an S+. The easiest way was just to snowball and get a super high KP, keep deaths reasonably low, and CS passably. It seemed like even if I was carrying with 20+ KP, having more than 4-5 deaths was enough to drop it to an S or lower. CS is also reasonably important, as illustrated best by a lot of the typical roaming midlaners. It's really easy to end up with 5cs/min or even less on a champion like Fizz, Leblanc, or Katarina, which doesn't matter in terms of the game very much if you've got a fully stacked Mejai's, but ending a 35 minute game 15/0/5 on a midlane assassin with 102 CS is a great way to not get your S+. I also found that role matters quite a bit. Playing a champion in an offrole tends to make it easier, as the level of performance needed to outperform OTHER people playing the offrole pick tends to be lower. I used a few odd jungle picks, as it tends to be safer for your KDA and lets you inflate your CS numbers a bit. I also found that you CAN get an S+ with reasonably low KP so long as your deaths are very low and your CS is very high. I had a number of ADC games where a scoreline of something like 2/0/7 with 9-10cs/min was enough for an S+.

There were a number of champions (probably in the realm of 20 or 30) that I managed to get on the first attempt. They were mostly champions that I'd played before that kinda just clicked when I was intentionally playing for the S+, but some (like Hwei) were surprising. I wish I had kept stats, but if I had to guess, I reckon the average amount of games it took was around 5 or so per champ.

One of the more general observations is that of all the champion archetypes, I had by far the hardest time with ADCs. This is due to what I have dubbed ""the ADC effect"". I'm sure my ADC mains out there have noticed it, but the idea of ""focusing the ADC"" has been so effectively programmed into everyone's minds that they continue to do so even when it is objectively the incorrect play. I had countless ADC games that were effectively disqualified from a possible S+ very early, simply because people will focus the ADC at all costs. There were SO many games where I would be playing an ADC during a dragon fight, with only a dagger and boots to my name, and get flash ulted by multiple enemies and die while my 4/0 midlaner with an item and a half goes completely untouched, resulting in the enemy losing the dragon and the fight. We often won those games due to this weird behavior, but it made it very hard to get an S+ on a number of ADCs because my death count would be too high.



Now for champion specifics:

Alistar: Probably the second hardest support. I can't pinpoint exactly why I had so much trouble, but it probably took me around 15 games. My intuition is that because Alistar exists strictly to augment and set up plays for allies who have kill pressure, in games where my team wasn't doing well I was relegated to just walking around and soaking XP. The main barrier was cooperative teammates.

Ashe: The ultimate victim of the ADC effect. I think I played around 25 games of Ashe, because it was absolutely impossible to find a game where the enemy Zed and Vi wouldn't come down and flash ult me under tower, even if it meant both of them dying. She isn't a hard champ by any means, and I won a lot of the games I played on her, but I ended a lot of them with 4-5 deaths due to nearly unavoidable circumstances, so it took quite a while.

Azir: I chalk this one up mostly to my inexperience with Azir, as I had probably only played 10-15 games of him total prior to trying for the S+. I play on over 100 ping and with locked cam (though since October I have learned to play unlocked), so learning to shuffle took me a few games on its own. I also found that although Azir's ""fantasy"" is an AP marksman focused around DPSing with soldiers, I had little success trying to play him this way. He feels misbalanced if this is supposed to be his playstyle, as you'd think that if the focus were his soldier DPS, repositioning them would be more achievable. His Q cooldown is so prohibitive throughout most of the game that you get one decent reposition in most fights, and then you're left with no damage for several seconds after they move out of the radius. I ended up getting the S+ on him running a burst-focused build and looking for shuffle plays. It was with old items, but I was running Luden's instead of Liandry's and rushing straight into mage core items like Rabs and Void Staff rather than picking up a Nashor's Tooth.

Milio: Another champion where I can't pinpoint the actual issue. It felt to me like his base kit was incredibly weak and non-impactful. His Q is reasonably strong in preventing all-ins, but he lacks a real way to make aggressive plays happen and push leads. His E also feels pitifully weak, as a lot of the strength is in your ADC using E and W to apply your passive, and a lot of people simply don't. Without using that portion of the power budget, his E is just a tiny shield and his W is just a tiny heal. It feels like most of his power is in his R (specifically the cleanse portion of it), but into teams with little CC it loses a lot of value. On top of that, your R only gets to really cash in on its budget in mid-late teamfights where you can heal/cleanse multiple people at once, and whether or not you get the S+ tends to be decided in laning phase. If you come out of lane even or behind, it's very hard to pull together enough KP, vision score, and gold to get an S+, especially as a support.

...and finally, Yuumi. What a bastard of a champion. The Yuumi S+ eluded me, so much so that I ended up mastery 4 on her after finally getting it despite only playing her a handful of times beforehand. I have no idea how they calculate grades for this stupid cat. I tried everything. EVERYTHING. I even had my friends letting me KS some games to try and force it. I had probably 10+ games where I thought ""certainly this is the S+"" and I'd roll a B- or something. It seems like Yuumi plays by entirely different rules. I even tried offrolling, and played Yuumi both mid and top, with stellar KDA, and still couldn't land the S+. Here are some examples:

Some normal support attempts:

And thus, I finally realized my shortcomings; I simply had not applied enough crutical shoelding. Armed with this new knowledge, I entered the rift once more, and proceeded to get the S+ on some random game where I went 4/1/31.

I have absolutely no idea what I did differently. I had a death, had comparable ward score to all of the other games (and even less ward score than some of the games where I got like an A-), and felt like I performed pretty average relative to some of my other games. I chalked it up to some sort of CIA mind control/torture experiment being facilitated by Riot, and went on to complete the remaining champions.

And that, my friends, is how you get an S+ on every champion. The new project is to get mastery 7 on every champion, which will take quite a bit longer as I'm currently sitting at about 5 completed. If anyone wants to know about a specific champion (e.g. how many games it took, any issues I encountered, or weird quirks I noticed), feel free to comment and if I remember the details about that champ, I'll talk about it a bit.

>""*I don't believe that Crit Marksman got severely nerfed here. Some of it was the shell shock of: 'I am a sustained damage dealer and the game is as bursty as it's been for a really long time.' That was true! I will totally believe you for like in 14.1 that 'I literally can not play Jinx because Fizz oneshots me.' Yes, an accurate statement! But, since that point in time, Shieldbow's pickrate has roughly doubled and overall time-to-kill in the game has gone back to where it was in 12.10 or 13.20 or 13.24 - and I think being Crit Marksman, as for this patch, will be completely fine. I do not agree with the reddit comments that ADC suck, I don't believe that is true!*""

The only thing that I will say to that is this: Lethality nerfs for Collector and Youmuu's in 14.3 are too slim that it will change anything to convince players to switch to standard crit itemisation. Plus, standard crit itemisation has been slightly nerfed for the start of the season while the players' experience with crit marksman is unchanged, arguably for quite some time, if Phreak likes it or not. And just to dismiss it nonchalantly by saying ""this is not true"" is not really enough. The win rates for marksman who are standard crit itemizers (SCI) compared to on-hit or lethality itemizers are really showing you the difference that SCI are not doing fine right now [for example: [d+/EUW](https://u.gg/lol/adc-tier-list?rank=diamond_plus&region=euw1) or [d2+/EUW](https://u.gg/lol/adc-tier-list?rank=diamond_2_plus&region=euw1)]. 

Throwing in the argument that Shieldbow purchase has doubled is not persuasive either since this item is stunting your scaling while it is underwhelming in terms of defense. Especially for the late game, it just keeps you alive for like 1 sec or less. 

Let's say: You face Fizz (Mid) and Rengar (Jungle) - you want to go Maw for Fizz, but you also want to do something about Rengar, and going GA is not just stunting your crit scaling (60% crit chance if you have Maw+GA); after one team fight, you lose it again while you can not purchase Shieldbow anymore because you have Maw as a restriction. The inefficiency is obvious and there are many examples!",2014,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1afczuf/phreak_i_dont_believe_adc_suck/,1706688878.0,0.9646

It's fine to play yuumi supp. But when your jg asks your adc to play jinx because she's broken, and your adc refuses, I think locking in Yuumi jg should be punished. Sure, you deal some damage, you try to kill the monsters...but you are obviously trying to ""punish"" the ADC and making him feel bad. Especially when I check the stats and see that you main actual jg champs.

If pro games can get a lane swap detector for gaming experience then soloQ should get a yuumi detector

Edit:

Some comments say well then what about other champions? Where do you draw the line? Maybe Yuumi jungle is secretly OP?

The thing is you can play to win as Yuumi jungle and you are still soft inting. No way they can make Yuumi jungle OP without making Yuumi supp broken. And if it's broken as Yuumi supp they would fix it. I would rather trolls play other off meta junglers because they would need to try harder to int.



And no, duo supp is never gonna be secretly OP. How would it get OP if your team gets reduced gold? 

And what about yuumi adc? Well I don't think there's a system can detect the difference between a yuumi adc and a lux supp, or a lux adc and a yuumi supp. So the yuumi detector cannot detect yuumi adc anyways. If you truly believe yuumi adc is good. You can still play it.

And why didn't I dodge? I could. But this has nothing to do with my point. Imagine multiple people doing this. Mid or I Yuumi jg. Play Jinx or I Yuumi jg...This will greatly affect player experience.

Ao we all agree that ADC mythics are kinda bad. And thats because they try to do the wrong thing. With every other class, mythics empower what makes the classes strong. Lets take mages for example, Ludens gives burst mages more burst dmg and Magic pen. 
Ludens gives mages that deal damage over time more of it. It empoweres there strenghts.

Meanwhile ADC items try to nullify the class' weakness. Galeforce gives mobility shieldbow surviveability. 
The problem with that is, if shield bow were strong enough to prevent you getting oneshot its would be completly OP, same with galeforce, if every adc wouldve gotten Ezreal E the item would be broken.

I as an adc main i dont mind being oneshot when i position wrong, but i want to deal big ammounts of damage when i position correctly. 
Kraken slayer was the only item done right thematicly but has other issues.

Reddit,Role-Based Complaints,adc weak,leagueoflegends,"ADCs are not weak, they just need QOL changes","ADCs are not weak, they just need QOL changes Hi, I'm an ADC main, and I’ve been playing the role since Season 8. My peak is Grandmaster on EUW, but most of my life I’ve spent in Master.  
There has been a trend for a long time now, and whenever a game isn’t heavily dominated by ADCs, people call the role weak. I honestly don’t feel that way at all. But there are things that make me unhappy, especially in the quality of life department for certain runes and items that just need polishing, starting with:

# Press the Attack:

Please make the rune stackable on multiple targets but procable only on one.  Whenever you play champions like **Miss Fortune** or **Zeri** with this rune, you need to make sure there is no target behind the one you’re hitting. Otherwise, the rune will simply reset on the guy behind.  
For example, on **Miss Fortune**, you need to auto-attack the target twice before you press **Q** to make sure it does not reset. I believe this is not how the rune should work and handicaps you for executing the combo right. The same can be said about **Yasuo**, **Yone**, **Senna**, etc. These are just the ones off the top of my head.

# Lethal Tempo:

This rune got removed and then came back slightly different, without being able to exceed the attack speed cap, with some extra damage.  
I hated the extra range on the original **Lethal Tempo** and felt like it was unnecessary, and Riot replaced that extra range reward for 6 stacks with extra damage that scales with attack speed. But you can no longer exceed the attack speed cap, which the old **Lethal Tempo** could, and that is the problem in my opinion.  
**Solution?** Allow exceeding the cap to **5.0** (current cap is 2.5) and remove the damage. Why? Champions like **Twitch**, **Kog'Maw** use on-hit items, so allow them to use on-hit items to their maximum rather than compensate them with damage from the rune. Make them deal damage with the items. **Varus**, for example, can exceed the cap, but only to 3.0.

# Essence Reaver:

This item got reworked to offer infinite mana upon completion but removed the **Sheen** effect, which was the sole purpose of the item.  
**Essence Reaver** went from having very clear identity users like **Ezreal**, **Lucian** to having no identity users.  
Sure, you can say that champions like **Xayah** and **Lucian** are the primary users now because they utilize it all—damage, mana, haste, and crit. But they build it mostly because, unlike most ADCs, they like to scale with spells and ability haste, and having infinite mana is just a bonus, not the reason you build it, unlike old **Essence Reaver**.  
I mean, you finish the item around the **12-14 minute mark**, and that’s when the early game is usually about to end and mid-game is around the corner. Mana is no longer a concern because you don’t need to stay on every wave forever. You want to base often because that’s how you get strong, and when you base, you replenish your mana, obviously, making the passive absolutely pointless after the early game. But you finish it in the mid-game, so the item has no chance to even have an identity. Compare it to **Lost Chapter**, which costs 1200 gold and is something you aim to get as a mage, or **Tear**, which you get at your max second base, around the 5-7 minute mark, and utilize the extra mana unlike Reaver.  
**Solution?** Bring back the old **Essence Reaver** or add an item, instead of **Warhammer**, that gives you a similar passive to **Lost Chapter** and functions as an actual infinite mana glitch.

# No matter the situation, you always have to go LDR:

I’m not ranting about **LDR** being useless, but this item lost its identity as a ""build-it-if-enemy-tanky"" scenario.  
Now, mathematically speaking, you are trolling if you don’t build **LDR** at least as your **4th item**, even if the enemy doesn’t even touch armor items. **30% Armor penetration** outclasses every single ADC item by far.  
Here’s the math and realistic scenario:  
You play **Jinx**, you go crit, starting off with **YunTal** into **IE** and **Hurricane**. The enemy team is full squishy, with **Quinn**, **Kha'Zix**, **Orianna** (no Zhonyas), **Caitlyn**, **Nami**. It’s the **25-minute mark**, and you are about to make a choice of what item to build. Well, you look at the enemy and think they’re all squishy, so you need **Collector**, right? Because that’s what the item is supposed to do—be strong into squishies. Well, that’s not the case.  
Let’s just go with the average armor at level 15, which should be around 90-ish. For calculations, let’s say **95** base armor. **Collector** reduces the armor to **85** with 10 lethality from the **Collector**.  
The way armor works is everything is calculated back to percentage-based damage, meaning that if you cut armor from 95 to 85, you are cutting it from 47.5% to 46.4% incoming physical damage, so 10 lethality gives you **1.1% extra damage**. Now, if **LDR** gives you **30% armor penetration**, the cut is from **95 to 66.5 armor**.  
Percentage-wise, we are looking at **38.4%** damage reduced, which, from the original **47.5%**, is a **9.1% extra damage** and **8% more damage** than with **Collector** as the 4th item, and that’s a big deal. And if we look at the fact that this is a scenario where **LDR** is LEAST effective, we have a problem in the item system and armor calculations in my book.

There are surely more things, but I’ve decided to just list the core ones in my opinion, and I hope that someone from Riot will give it a thought. I love League and I love marksmen. Also, just a clarification: I don’t think bot lane being ""dominated"" by mages in solo queue is a problem. Mages spike at 1-3 items, while ADCs spike later. If mages are a problem, we will see it in probably mid-February in Pro-play meta  
  
Thanks for your time, and sorry for my broken English. Have a nice day.

When top lane bruisers or enchanter supports or assassins are weak, there aren't picked at all. This is something that really gets my neural processing unit fired up. I would like to know why ADCs get picked this much. If it was just because ""ADC mains have fun with ADC"", then wouldn't competitive play not reflect that? The primary goal in competitive play is to win, not to have fun. 

I am beginning to suspect that ADC champions are never as weak as ADC mains claim. ",1030,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ag6ym1/when_adcs_are_weak_in_the_meta_there_is_still_at/,1547546356.0,0.2481
Reddit,Role-Based Complaints,adc weak,leagueoflegends,"If ADCs want to be able to outplay their intended class weaknesses, then make ADC damage outplayable too","If ADCs want to be able to outplay their intended class weaknesses, then make ADC damage outplayable too It irks me when ADC mains complain about not being able to deal with assassins. Firstly, assassins are easily dealt with in a teamfight. What they are referring to is 1v1 situations, but an assassin should rightfully have an advantage in this situation. The issue with this complaint is that they want counterplay to their weakness as a class (every class is weak to another class), yet their own damage has very minimal counterplay. It's targeted, resourceless and a sub-1 second cooldown. So basically, they want to have more counterplay to their enemies damage, than what their enemies have to the ADC's damage. This is what I call the Yasuo Problem; So many people despise facing a Yasuo, and that's because he has good stats, but has significantly more ways to outplay you than you have to do the same to him. 

ADCs are statballs, and statballs are balanced by being feast or famine. Statballs like Darius and Volibear are balanced by having minimal counterplay when ahead, but then have minimal outplay potential and minimal ways of being useful when behind. For ADCs it's more scenario based; they have a similar level of oppression when they are protected by their team, and so are balanced by not being able to do much when alone. 

Mages generally have an easier time dealing with assassins, because they often have CC or defensive mechanics like shields. But mages in turn are also much easier to outplay because the have skillshots; there isn't a single mage anymore whose entire damage output is point and click. The closest thing would be Cass, but she needs to land Qs to keep her damage up. So ADCs shouldn't be given similar amount of tools as a mage to deal with assassins unless a similar amount of their own damage was avoidable. But that would require a rework of auto fundamentals, or reworking the class so that the majority of their damage isn't tied to autos, but that's just insane to even conceive of at this point. 

It also irks me how ADCs complain about being so dependant on their teammates. When you do the most damage of any class and it's all point-and-click, there needs to be tradeoffs. Let's not forget that teams do the most for an ADC whilst they ADC does the least for them in return. ADCs have the lowest vision and playmaking burden, and will always get priority for farm. They rarely ever take the time to set up vision that goes beyond giving themselves cover to farm. They rarely  ever roam into other lanes by themselves to to make solo-plays. Think of how many times you see an ADC farming a sidelane whilst the rest of team sacrifices farm to defend a tower. They're almost always the last person to rotate to an objective despite being the most important one. 

Getting focused the most is balanced out by being protected the most and being spoon-fed the most. It might suck getting focused and feeling powerless when your team doesn't peel, but that's the trade-off you made in role select when you picked a statball with a lower playmaking and vision burden. You can complain about your team being bad, but had you picked another role you would have to do more work in the early and mid-game to make your ADC impatful later on. You would have had to win your lane by yourself. You would have to get vision down to protect yourself, but also to help your jungler/control objectives/ set up picks. You would then have to bring your advantage into other lanes by making impactful roams. You would have to learn the right times to sacrifice farm in order to make these roams, or to do things like contest/defend objectives. It's similar to picking Nasus; you're trading out the need to make plays and being on a timer like someone like Renekton, in exchange for being a minimal counterplay splitpushing-statball in the lategame if your team does well. 

But yeah, I just think ADCs are super entitled.

Reddit,Role-Based Complaints,adc weak,leagueoflegends,ADC is weak because hyper-roaming midlaners have no good answer.,"ADC is weak because hyper-roaming midlaners have no good answer. ADC is a good role, but it's nearly impossible for your team to punish a hyper roaming midlaner. This means you are forced to super safe out of fear for the 4 man bot - which means you forfeit resources and can't push an advantage.

Think of it this way - There are only 3 decent responses to a roaming midlaner:

1) Take rift and drop it mid, trading botlane for the mid turret. This is by far the best response, but still lackluster. If the roaming mid and jg end up picking a doublekill bot and drake, along with the entire botside jungle, then it ends up being a net loss. Not to mention you need toplane priority for this to work, and a jungler who knows what they are doing. Plus, rift herald takes way too long to kill, so you end up giving too much to the enemy team.

2) Match the roam - this is super risky against midlane assassins (rule #1 of midlane is pretty much never follow assassin roams, since they could just sit in river and cheese you). Plus, most of the time, botlane will die long before you arrive, so there is very little chance of it working out for you.

3) Take plates midlane. This is also risky, since a fed assassin midlane opponent can just run back into lane and kill you. Plus, the reward is kind of lackluster - the midlaner getting 2 kills bot equates to ~400 gold, plus botlane plates, plus drake, on top of denying botlane a ton of cs. In exchange, taking plates would likely only give you around 300 gold (assuming two plates at best), and deny about 2 waves of cs, while giving up a valuable objective.

On top of this, midlaners are hardly punished for leaving lane. They lose atmost one wave of cs, but in the process force sidelanes to forfeit their pushes, since it's actually just death if you stay pushed. Even the threat of a roam results in lost resources in botlane - and given how snowbally all the midlane picks are right now, giving up any kills to midlane means the game is actually over.

TL;DR Hyper roaming midlaners are grossly overtuned, and ADC will benefit greatly as a role if they are nerfed.

Edit: This is getting a ton of traction! Just to clarify, this is what I think makes adcs weak in solo queue - I don't know anything about how this would impact adc in pro play. In the end, I trust that Riot knows what they are doing.",672,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/gbq82s/adc_is_weak_because_hyperroaming_midlaners_have/,1588366553.0,-0.9886

Reddit,Role-Based Complaints,support carry,leagueoflegends,How to Carry my Carry: An Introduction to Support Changes in Preseason,"How to Carry my Carry: An Introduction to Support Changes in Preseason Hello Summoners, 

I’m here today to talk about supports – those zero-CS players who devote themselves (and their income) to warding my gank paths and protecting their team without any tangible character growth in the later parts of the game. As a terrifying predator who feeds on the lowly support, I’d prefer to have a low-income, no-item target to prey on in the late game, but as a player and designer…

… fine. 

Your pleas have reached us. We have crafted a new world with our dark arts. Behold!

###How are Supports in the present day?

First off, let’s clarify who we’re talking about. There are six roles in League of Legends: mage, assassin, tank, fighter, marksman and support. The current meta in League of Legends usually divvies up these roles into the following positions: top fighter, mid mage, jungler tank (or assassin), bottom marksman and bottom support.  

However, “support” is a blanket term that covers three overlapping, but different categories: 
* Player who doesn’t last hit while sharing a lane
* Dedicated ward dispenser
* Support champions

While we’ve come to accept a single player performing all three of these roles, if you look closely, you’ll see these roles fight each other:

* Players who don’t last hit but share lane have minimal gold income
* Warding costs gold and warding power increases dramatically with additional wards placed

* Warding requires you to move away from your allies constantly
* Supportive champions want to be near teammates, protecting them

From these points, we can see that 0-cs warding duo-lane support players are the poorest players with the highest consumable expenses and the lowest amount of character growth. Duo-laning support players are currently denied the second half of their growth story!
 
###What’s changing in the preseason?

We want both players in a shared lane to experience growth, item choice and the opportunity to get a full set of items. To get there, we are:

* Increasing the gold income for players who don’t last hit
* Introducing bonus XP in  jungle and lane for players who fall significantly behind their teammates
* Capping possible expenditures on wards per player
* Giving players access to free vision items, known as Trinkets (Please see Xypherous’s vision post for details!)  http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p4u6i/sight_beyond_sight_an_introduction_to_preseason_4/

Additionally, new income comes in several forms:

* Masteries that grant bonus gold to players in a shared lane
* Improvements to our GP/5 items that reward effective support play
* Increased assist rewards for players who get significantly more assists than kills 

Increasing income, rewarding effective support play and giving everyone access to a basic vision item encourages team cooperation, rewards supportive players and gives everyone the opportunity to participate in the vision game.

###Outside of the vision changes, what’s happening to address the above?

First I’ll touch on assist streaks. We’re making it so that players who have significantly more assists than kills will get additional income per assist. If a player does secure a kill, the extra gold from the kill will offset their temporarily decreased gold gain from extra assists.

In addition to assist streaks, we’re exploring masteries that provide additional early game income and we’ve added items that allow support players to gain additional income for supporting their allies, taking objectives and setting up team fights. 

Let’s look at a few of the work-in-progress items that I’m talking about:

* Philosopher’s Stone grants gold every 10 seconds. When a nearby ally kills a minion, you earn gold. 
* Executioner’s Emblem executes minions below 200 health and grants gold to both you and the nearest ally when you last hit. Your ally gains a small gold bonus on top of this. This effect can happen up to twice a minute. 
* Spellthief’s Blade makes it so that your spells and basic attacks against enemy champions grant you gold. It cannot affect the same target more than once every 10 seconds and last hitting an enemy disables this effect for 10 seconds.

Access to these items will allow you to specialize your income to fit your playstyle. 

###How does this change my experience as a support player?

In a long game, shared lane supports should now expect to be purchasing real items alongside their boots and Sightstone. They’ll still have the biggest impact on vision, but now will have combat stats to make them feel like a more full and complete character. A balanced support champion will be splitting their time between warding, helping allies push lanes to take towers and participating in combat to save allies and kill enemies.   

As a side effect of these changes, we’re also taking a close look at core supports: Janna, Sona, Nami, Soraka, Lulu, Taric, etc. Champions designed specifically as supports have historically been balanced to have negligible income so, if left alone with all that gold, they’ll either become overtuned mages or be replaced completely by non-support champions who can outscale them in damage once they hit the midgame.

Rather than wholesale nerfing these champions, we’re looking at opportunities to make their unique aspects scale with AP or other stats. For example, the bonus AD on Janna’s shield and the movement speed granted by Nami’s passive will now scale with Ability Power. Our hope is that support champions in shared lanes can select AP or CDR items they find appealing. This will, in turn, give them a more distinct identity as champions that excel at helping their teammates and being supportive rather than just dealing more damage.

Hopefully this gives all you support players some things to look forward to in preseason. We’re going to be aggressively tuning these changes but our core philosophy will remain the same: let every champion in League of Legends experience real growth throughout the game, regardless of their position or role. 

We'll also be posting this on reddit where we may pass through to clarify some questions. At the start of next week we'll be doing a global recap to follow up with the most up-to-date information from questions around the world!

Thanks for all of the input that's helped us get this far.

Reddit,Role-Based Complaints,support carry,leagueoflegends,I think every support main should play ad carry at least once,"I think every support main should play ad carry at least once I'll give some brief background history before explaining why I think this, also take this with a grain of salt since I'm just silver.

When I started playing League (around season 5 or 6), I had a potato for a computer so I'd usually be left with support. This wasn't too bad since I'd end playing easy supports like Janna or Soraka. Not too long until I encountered angry adcs who'd flame me for taking a single CS or not warding. It's no surprise why it's popular to generalize adc mains as whiny, bossy, or super toxic. And back then, I fully agreed that they were ***all*** just the worst kinds of people in league.

But then I actually tried playing ADC.

Holy crap. My farming was atrocious, every lane trade went awful for me, and I'd do pathetic damage late game cuz positioning was bad too. It was also at this time I realized how frustrating the adc role was.

* Did you misclick the ground and missed a last hit on the cannon or low champion? Looks like you can't afford that B.F sword or finish an item.
* Do you have a support that's scared of their own shadow and doesn't even walk up in lane? It's now a 1v2
* Do you have a trigger-happy support that engages even if you aren't there? Proceeds to get flamed/trolled for the rest of the game and its a 1v3
* Do you want to get that last wave or plate so you can afford an extra item? Enemy hecarim activates predator and you're either behind or lost a lead
* Did you win lane? Proceeds to get 1 shot by the fed assassin/mage/bruiser/tank

I'm not saying all adc's are misunderstood angels that we should forgive. I just think that sometimes they probably get too much hate, and it's understandable (NOT justified) why they get toxic.",1412,https://reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/bkj7es/i_think_every_support_main_should_play_ad_carry/,1556959883.0,-0.6508

In this time, the bab- I mean, ADC, might get undernouris- low on cs. Might even get dived, In general this is a phase of misery for them in which they might call for mommy, reminding her of their needs... Which is why guilt might hit the support, pushing them to actually ward botlane in the same way that an abusive parent packs lunchables and calls it a day, ready to neglect that bothersome little creature again.

She is now here for you and will support you in whatever you do! ADCs generally cope as well as they can. Their mother was abusive, yes, but it's the only one they have, and they would rather have her later than never
